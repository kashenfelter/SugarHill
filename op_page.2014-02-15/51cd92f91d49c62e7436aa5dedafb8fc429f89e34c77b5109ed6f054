		SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (NON-R&amp;D)<br />
<p>TITLE: OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE ALAMOGORDO PRIMATE FACILITY (APF)</p><br />
<p>General Information<br />Posted Date: February 7, 2014<br />Close Date: February 17, 2014 2:30pm</p><br />
<p>Duration: 10 Days</p><br />
<p>NAICS Code: 541940 --Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services-- Veterinary Services<br /><br />The National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a Sources Sought Notice to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified businesses serving the needs mentioned below. Per FAR 10.001(a)(3)(i) agencies must use the results of market research to determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. This Sources Sought Notice should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.</p><br />
<p><br />PURPOSE</p><br />
<p>The purpose of this Notice is to determine the capabilities of any organizations capable of operating and maintaining the Alamagordo Primate Facility (APF) and its animal care and use program. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Air Force (USAF) have an agreement to house and care for chimpanzees at USAF's facility named Alamagordo Primate Facility (APF) located in Alamogordo, New Mexico. MAINTENANCE OF CHIMPANZEES IS REQUIRED; NO RESEARCH IS REQUIRED OR ALLOWED. The current permit use agreement between the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Air Force (USAF) prescribe that no invasive research shall be conducted on the chimpanzees currently held at the APF. In the event a decision is made to include any or all of those animals in further new or on-going NIH-approved research, the animals shall be transported off-base.</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p><br />BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p><br />
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires a Contractor to operate and maintain the APF and its animal care and use program. The APF occupies a series of closely located buildings on the Holloman Air Force Base (HAFB). Each of Buildings 1301, 1302, 1303, and 1304 can house approximately 72 animals, in 12 dens holding approximately 6 animals each. Thus, the theoretical caging capacity is approximately 288 chimpanzees.</p><br />
<p>The current primate population at APF is approximately 160 chimpanzees caged in single sex groups. No research will be conducted. All the chimpanzees have been exposed to microorganisms such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or both. These chimpanzees need to be routinely monitored and cared for. Few of the 160 chimpanzees are vasectomized or implanted with Norplant. NO MORE ANIMALS CAN BE BROUGHT ON BASE OR EXCHANGED FOR EXISTING ANIMALS. Any NIH-owned animals taken off the base cannot be returned to the base. The number of chimpanzees is expected to decrease over time as: they are needed elsewhere, they die due to natural causes, or possibly they are retired to sanctuaries.</p><br />
<p><br />OWNERSHIP ISSUES</p><br />
<p>The NIH will retain title to the chimpanzees, except if an appropriate transferee who will take title is identified. The animals will then be moved off-base at the expense of the transferee. There is no requirement or expectation for the Contractor to take title to the chimpanzees.</p><br />
<p>The lifetime costs associated with any removed animal's housing and maintenance becomes the permanent responsibility of the organization (transferee) receiving ownership of the animals. The potential transferee shall obtain permission, after supplying adequate documentation of the proposed use and adequate long-term financial arrangements, from the NIH before removing any animals from the APF. The Contractor shall be responsible for the administrative procedures associated with the transfer, and shipping of the animals.</p><br />
<p><br />REQUIREMENTS</p><br />
<p>All Contractor vehicle drivers shall possess a valid driver's license and must have a safe driving record with no evidence of DWI or DUI. The Contractor shall maintain a certificate of vehicle liability insurance for all Contractor vehicles operated at the APF for the duration of this Contract.</p><br />
<p>PERSONNEL - The following description is the present estimate of the staff that will be required:</p><br />
<p>Professional Staff - Director, one additional Veterinarian, and Nurse/OSH Officer</p><br />
<p>Technical Staff - Program Administrator, Information Technologist, Behaviorist, Clinical Technician, Colony Manager, Secretary</p><br />
<p>Animal Care Staff - 1-2 supervisory and 13-14 other, including one or more enrichment technicians</p><br />
<p>Maintenance Staff - 1 supervisory and 4 other</p><br />
<p><br />CONSULTANTS AND NECROPSY SERVICE - The perceived advantage of having consultants is that they would not have to be retained as full-time employees, and some would not necessarily have to be located in New Mexico. An off-site veterinary pathologist and related services (such as those available from other locations of the Contractor) may be needed to necropsy animals, and process and interpret necropsy tissues. In addition, the Contractor should develop a formal agreement with an Alamogordo or Las Cruces physician who will provide scheduled and emergency consultations and care, related to potential zoonoses acquired from chimpanzees.</p><br />
<p>ON-SITE TRAINING - New hire training and periodic refresher training for all employees will be needed for employees at all levels. Guidance regarding these issues can be obtained from the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), the Guide for the care and Use of Laboratory Animals, American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS), American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine (ACLAM), and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).</p><br />
<p>ANIMAL CARE - In accordance with the current NIH-held Animal Welfare, APF contractor staff shall receive training comparable to that provided by the Associate Director for Training, Education, and Program-Liaison which will be approved by the Director, Office of Animal Care and Use (OACU), and presented by Contractor personnel at the APF.</p><br />
<p>MAJOR CHALLENGES - The major challenges at the APF result from the desert climate with its rapidly fluctuating temperatures, and the biosafety considerations for these chimpanzees. A walk-through every 2 hours for temperature monitoring, security reasons, and gross observation of the animals is required. Protective clothing, appropriate showering, proper waste disposal, and other BL2/BL3 biosafety practices are necessary. All the animals have been exposed to microorganisms such as hepatitis C virus(HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus HIV), or both. Not all animals exhibit signs of active infection but all animals should be routinely monitored for infection.</p><br />
<p>DIET - Standard commercially available chow supplemented with fresh fruits and vegetables.</p><br />
<p>SANITATION - Hosing of floors 2 times/day, periodic pressure washing of cage surfaces.</p><br />
<p>HEALTH CARE - Periodic physicals and TB testing for all chimpanzees, serum and DNA and possibly semen banking, blood sampling and shipping for off&shy; site HIV and HCV testing, standard vaccinations and other standard preventative health care for chimpanzees, veterinary care for unexpected health problems and wounding from cage-mates, and rare instances of euthanasia when ordered by a veterinarian considering the best interests of a particular chimpanzee.</p><br />
<p>PREVENTION OF BREEDING/GROUPING OF CHIMPANZEES - The 160 animals have already been divided into cages containing animals of the same sex, and this shall continue to be the primary method used to prevent breeding. In this case, some shields may need to be placed to prevent inter-cage copulation. However, since non-single housing is a primary need for environmental enrichment, and not all adult male chimpanzees can be co&shy; housed with other male chimpanzees, other allowable methods to prevent breeding can include vasectomy, tubal ligation, Norplant implants, and pregnancy terminations. NIH expects that no conceptions of chimpanzees at the APF will occur, and for surgical terminations to be performed if they do occur. The Air Force will require that any chimpanzee that is born at the APF be removed, probably with its mother, within 30 days of birth.</p><br />
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT - A behaviorist shall provide environmental enrichment to all 160 animals. A primary need of chimpanzees is to be housed with other conspecifics whenever possible (in the opinion of the Behaviorist). The chimpanzees shall be allowed access to the outdoors when climatically advisable, and be provided indoor shelter when necessary. Buildings 1301, 1302, 1303, and 1304 each include 12 cages with indoor and outdoor sections that together hold approximately 6 animals per cage.</p><br />
<p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY - Animal records shall be maintained on all animals, to include both behavioral and clinical health records. Security procedures such as the use of passwords and backup copies, and LAN system implementation and maintenance shall be performed.</p><br />
<p>CLINICAL LAB ACCESS - Access to on-site or off-site clinical lab capabilities is necessary to maintain the health of the 160 chimpanzees.</p><br />
<p>NECROPSY - Approximately 3 to 6% of the APF chimpanzee population may die each year; this rate is likely to increase as the population continues to age. Any instances of animal death or injury must be reported by phone or email to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and the Director, NIH OACU, within 24 hours. Any such incidents deemed to be significant deficiencies according to PHS Policy will be verbally reported to OLAW and followed-up in writing upon completion of appropriate Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) investigations and implementation of corrective actions. In the case of a death from an unknown cause, a necropsy must be done under BSL2 containment.</p><br />
<p>ADMINISTRATIVE - A variety of logistical methods mixing on-site and off-site capabilities can be used to satisfy administrative requirements. Various types of umbrella liability, employee injury, renter's insurance for damage to the buildings and theft of contents, vehicle insurance, etc. shall be obtained as needed by the Contractor. One definite need is that all costs for operating and maintaining the APF must receive separate accounting from other costs to the Contractor for other sites and tasks. Inspections by the COR and/or Contracting Officer are to be expected, but it is not likely that a NIH representative will usually be located on-site.</p><br />
<p>USDA, OLAW, AAALAC - Intramural NIH's Animal Welfare Assurance includes the APF, and expects the APF to hold a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) R Registration for the APF, and continue to be subject to courtesy inspections. It is expected that both USDA and AAALAC representatives will periodically visit the APF and issue reports to the Contractor and NIH. Major Alterations and Renovations may be needed to the APF to correct deficiencies that the USDA may categorize as "must be replaced or repaired." The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining estimates for these repairs, and the workscope of the contract and funds for its completion shall be modified as necessary. After discussion with NIH staff members, deficiencies identified during AAALAC site visits will be addressed. The APF will continue to maintain accreditation by AAALAC. In addition, as noted on page 6 of NIH POLICY MANUAL 3040-2 ANIMAL CARE AND USE IN THE INTRAMURAL PROGRAM, please see (http://oacu.od.nih.gov/NIHpolicy/3040-2.pdf), the NIH Director of OACU will review and approve all animal facility renovation plans.</p><br />
<p>A license from the Drug Enforcement Agency to one or more veterinary staff of the APF for the use of drugs in chimpanzees at the APF will be required.</p><br />
<p>ACUC - Since Intramural NIH holds the Animal Welfare Assurance, the designees of this subdivision of NIH will manage the ACUC in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the Director of NCRR (now Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (ORIP) and the Deputy Director of Intramural Research. The ACUC will be constituted and meet in New Mexico, and will provide the functions required by OLAW, USDA, and pages 11-13 of NIH Policy Manual 3040-2. Required reports from the ACUC will be described in the Contract document upon award. Members from the Contractor's staff and outside members with appropriate qualifications will be appointed by the Director of the Office of Research Infrastructure Programs, to serve on the ACUC. As specified in the Memorandum of Understanding between the Director, NCRR and the Deputy Director of Intramural Research, any instances of animal death or injury must be reported by phone or email to both the COR and the Director, NIH OACU, within 24 hours. Any such incidents deemed to be significant deficiencies according to PHS Policy will be verbally reported to OLAW and followed-up in writing upon completion of appropriate ACUC investigations and implementation of corrective actions.</p><br />
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for the selection, certification, assessment, supervision, management, and control of employees. The Contractor shall provide veterinary care and husbandry service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every day of the year, including weekends and Government holidays. Contractor staff shall be designated essential employees, and at least a minimal staff shall report for duty every day of the year, including periods of inclement/severe weather or other adverse working conditions. The Contractor shall observe the same holidays as the Federal Government.</p><br />
<p>The Contractor shall document actual employee hours worked by use of a time sheet, time clock, or other time keeping method, and shall only bill for actual hours worked. Overtime and holiday pay shall be justified. The Contractor shall maintain a flexible work schedule and shall use a cost&shy; effective method of providing essential coverage after normal working hours, on weekends, Government holidays, and other periods of Government closure, and may include staggered or alternative schedules. The Contractor shall organize the workforce in a way that critical functions are performed even when unforeseen absences of personnel occur.</p><br />
<p>SECURITY - The Contractor shall ensure that an effective security system and procedures are in place at the AFP, and procure and establish these if necessary. The Government is not liable for the loss of personal possessions of the Contractor or its staff. The HAFB has a manned guard booth that restricts vehicular access to the large HAFB. During non&shy;regular business hours, a walk-through of the various APF buildings every 2-4 hours for temperature monitoring, security reasons, and gross observation of the animals is required. Plans for replacing all or some of the walk-throughs by use of video and other electronic surveillance methods shall be approved in advance by the APF ACUC and the COR, and be submitted to the Director, NIH OACU.

<p>The Contractor shall establish an Occupational Medical Program and provide employees with appropriate medical care to include pre-employment evaluations, occupational medical surveillance, and job-related emergency treatment.</p><br />
<p>The contractor shall conduct a pre-placement medical evaluation to determine if the applicant is currently medically and physically able to fulfill the requirements of the position without risk of injury or illness to themselves, other individuals or the animals; provide the applicant with position-related health and safety information; and provide the applicant with appropriate immunizations to reduce the risk of a work&shy; related infection. The pre-placement medical evaluation shall include: i) Occupational medical history, ii) Safety and health counseling, iii)Pre-employment drug screen, iv) Tetanus screening (immunization within last 10 years), v) Baseline audiogram for employees exposed to elevated noise levels, vi) Pulmonary function for employees required to wear full face respirators, vii) Other appropriate immunizations and screenings determined by the species (chimpanzees) and potential hazards (HIV, HBV, HCV, and possibly HAV) that the contract employee will be exposed.</p><br />
<p>The Contractor shall establish an Occupational Medical Surveillance Program. Employees shall be required to participate in this program if they are involved in the direct care of animals or their living quarters, or have direct contact with live or dead animals, their viable tissues, body fluids or waste. The Contractor's Occupational Medical Surveillance Program shall be organized so that the level of surveillance is appropriate for the species and potential hazard that the contract employee will be exposed to, e.g., i) Chimpanzees, ii) Chimpanzee tissues.</p><br />

Contractor personnel entering the HAFB shall comply with all relevant HAFB Health and Safety requirements. Persons having active tuberculosis shall be excluded from work with contract chimpanzees. All appropriate personnel shall be immunized against hepatitis A and C, HIV, and other relevant diseases as safe and effective vaccines become available.</p><br />
<p>CONTINUED HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND A SERUM BANK - A schedule for periodic blood banking, TB testing and revaccination of employees with chimpanzee contact shall be followed.</p><br />
<p>EMERGENCY CARE plans on a 24/7 basis shall be maintained and provided to all employees.</p><br />
<p>PREEMPLOYMENT AND CONTINUED TRAINING REGARDING OSH for microbiological biosafety and prevention of chimpanzee-related injuries is necessary.</p><br />
<p>WASTES - At present, urine and feces from the chimpanzees are treated at the same sewage treatment plant that receives potentially HIV and HCV&shy; contaminated-human sewage. Sharps such as hypodermic needles, soiled personnel protective equipment, and animal tissues that are potentially biohazardous must be appropriately treated and disposed, probably through an appropriate commercial company such as Stericycle of El Paso, Texas.</p><br />
<p>MAINTENANCE - Maintenance and minor repairs to the interior and exterior and for general maintenance of the APF shall be performed.</p><br />
<p>MODERNIZATION - The Contractor shall develop a proactive method by which necessary major repairs are identified, evaluated, and implemented in a timely manner. The methods for this are expected to vary depending on the scope and severity and expense of the repair.</p><br />
<p>USDA INSPECTIONS - The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the APF complies with standards established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture {USDA) and the Public Health Service (PHS). However, major Alterations and Renovations may be needed to the APF to correct deficiencies that the USDA may categorize as "must be replaced or repaired." The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining estimates for these repairs, and the workscope of the contract and funds for its completion will be modified as necessary. After discussion with NIH staff members, deficiencies identified during AAALAC site visits will be addressed. The APF shall maintain accreditation by AAALAC. As noted on page 6 of NIH Policy Manual 3040-2, the NIH Director OACU will review and approve all animal facility renovation plans.</p><br />
<p>SHIPPING OF ANIMALS TO OTHER LOCATIONS - If and when a transferee is willing to accept chimpanzees from the APF, and the NIH ChiMP office has approved the transfer in writing, the Contractor shall cooperate with the shipping effort. If the operation of the APF or if the APF animals are transferred to a new contractor, grantee or owner, all medical records shall be transferred to the new contractor/grantee/owner and remain with the animals. It is anticipated that all animals currently residing at the APF facility will die of natural causes or be transferred to other facilities before contract expiration. A list of relevant regulations and considerations for shipping of chimpanzees is available from the Contracting Officer.</p><br />
<p>UTILITIES - As discussed in the Use Permit, the Air Force will provide electricity, gas, water, and disposal of wastewater up to a designated cost per month. Any costs above this designated cost per month will be paid by NIH via the contract, unless the Contractor has been negligent in the use of utilities.</p><br />
<p>REQUESTS FOR TOURS AND CONGRESSIONAL/MEDIA INTEREST - NIH animal facilities have controlled access and shall not be opened to the public, for a variety of reasons. Requests by outside individuals or groups to visit NIH animal facilities shall be coordinated through the OACU, OIR, the Division of Police, ORS, and the COR. The COR and the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison shall be notified, in writing, of all such requests.</p><br />
<p><br />MANDATORY CRITERIA</p><br />
<p>Nonhuman primates can carry a variety of zoonotic agents that can be transmitted to humans and other non-infected animals. For example, some of these infectious agents, such as hepatitis B and C, may have been acquired through previous exposure and may persist in the animal for a significant period of its lifetime. These potential risks increase the importance of identifying infectious hazards for humans working with nonhuman primates. Therefore the offeror must demonstrate the following:</p><br />
<p>1) Proper experience in the identification, handling, and maintenance of infected chimpanzees. <br />2) Proper experience and knowledge of nonhuman primate infectious agents, including hepatitis B and C agents.</p><br />
<p>No proposals will be considered without demonstrating these two specifications.</p><br />
