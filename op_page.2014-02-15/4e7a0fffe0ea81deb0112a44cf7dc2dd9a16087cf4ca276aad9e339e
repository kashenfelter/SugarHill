The KBSC supports theater level training exercises in the Republic of Korea and Japan, Training and Mission Rehearsal Exercises (MRX) and facilitates Joint, Combined, coalition training, and Service Component commander, staff and leader CAX from battalion to Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF).  <br> 1.3.1. KBSC is assigned to CFC/USFK CJ3 and serves as the USARPAC Pacific Regional Simulation Center.  The KBSC, located in the Walker Center at Yongsan Army Garrison, Seoul Korea, is the primary location for simulation driven exercises at the division level and higher using constructive simulation federations.   For the purpose of Eighth Army exercises, the KBSC responds to the Eighth Army G37.  For all other exercises, the KBSC responds to the supported commander or exercise director. <br> 1.3.1.1.  Background Information.  The KBSC was established by US Forces Korea/Eighth US Army (USFK/8A) in September of 1991.  It provides Combined Forces Command (CFC)/US Forces Korea (USFK)/Eighth Army (8A)/ US Army Pacific/USPACOM, commanders and staffs, their components and major subordinate commands, the ROK Armed Forces, and others with cost effective training alternatives to restrictions imposed by the increased complexity and ranges of current and emerging weapons systems, as well as limited maneuver areas, OPTEMPO, and training dollars.  CFC is scheduled to  undergo Operational Control Transition from US led to ROK led-US supported during this contract period. The contractor shall be required to fully support this transition effort in the performance of this contract.  Included in this transition will be physical move of KBSC from its current location to Camp Humphreys.  The government is responsible for movement of all Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). <br> 1.3.1.1.1.  KBSC Missions. <br> 1.3.1.1.1.1.  Conduct CFC theater level CAX  <br> 1.3.1.1.1.2.  Support 8A and 2nd Infantry Division Exercises <br> 1.3.1.1.1.3.  Serve as USARPAC Regional Simulation Center (RSC)  <br> 1.3.1.1.1.4.  Provide simulation support to USPACOM. <br> 1.3.1.1.1.5.  Support the US Army Mission Command Training Program (MCTP). <br> 1.3.1.1.1.6.  Assist ROK Armed Forces in the use of simulations in training  <br> 1.3.1.1.1.7. Plan, coordinate, and conduct other exercises, training, test and fielding events.  <br> 1.3.1.1.2.  Purpose and Operating Philosophy.  <br> 1.3.1.1.2.1.   The KBSC exists to enhance the readiness of the ROK/US Combined Forces Command; United States Forces, Korea; Eighth Army; US Army Pacific; USPACOM; and other selected US and allied military organizations.  The KBSC facilitates the training of these organizations by supporting the conduct of combined, joint, and service exercises from the theater through the small unit level.  Normally they are simulation-driven Command Post Exercises (CPXs).  However, they may be scripted CPXs, Field Training Exercises (FTXs), Mission Rehearsal Exercises (MRX), Combined Counter-Fire Exercises (CCX), or combinations thereof involving the use of L-V-C-G technology. <br> 1.3.1.1.2.2.  The KBSC is a service organization devoted to satisfying the customer (the training audience) by providing a high quality product (realistic, stressful, first-rate exercises).  It provides the full spectrum training environment through battle staff training.  <br> 1.3.1.1.2.3.  The KBSC approach to training through exercise planning and execution is characterized by the tenets of major combat  operations.  Careful attention is paid to clearly defining for each exercise, the training audience, training objectives, and resources available to conduct the exercise. <br> 1.3.1.1.2.4.  In general, exercises are taken to the training audience . . . not the reverse.  Whenever dictated by the needs of an exercise, simulations will be distributed to remote sites.  The KBSC is manned, equipped, and attuned to conducting bare-base, remote operations. <br> 1.3.1.2. Warrior Mission Planning and Rehearsal Complex (WMPRC), located at Camp Casey, Dongduchon, Republic of Korea provides realistic maneuver training to Battalions and Brigades, conducts Combined Counterfire Exercises (CCX) and Mission Rehearsal Exercises (MRX). Primary simulation federations used are the Joint Live Virtual Constructive (JLVC) Federation and/or Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability - Entity Resolution Federation (JLCCTC-ERF).  In coordination with Training Support Activity Korea (TSAK), virtual simulators and gaming models are used to support live, virtual, constructive (LVC) exercises.  The KBSC wide area network (Not part of this contract) provides the Live, Virtual, Constructive-Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) to conduct these exercises.  <br> 1.3.2.  The use of simulations as a training tool for commanders at theater level and below requires innovative thinking and dynamic procedures to employ them in a manner that provides supported commanders and staff a realistic view of the modern battlefield.  Simulations place the command and control elements of the training audience in an environment that stresses decision-making, coordination, and staff interaction. Role players located in simulation centers, communicate with the training audience via organic communication links. In some cases, computer simulations feed data directly to the mission command systems of the training audience. Contractors assume multiple roles in assisting participants during the conduct of a simulation exercise.  <br> 1.4.  Period of Performance. The period of performance will be from 1 July 2014 to 31 March 2015 (9 months)  inclusive of 30 days phase-in period with four (4) one-year option periods. <br> 1.5.  General Information. <br> 1.5.1.  Hours of Operation.  <br> 1.5.1.1.  Normal Hours.  The KBSC normal operation hours are 0800-1700 hours, Monday through Friday, excluding U.S. federal holidays or when the Government facility is closed due to local or national emergencies, administrative closings, or similar Government directed facility closings. The contractor must at all times maintain sufficient workforce for the uninterrupted performance of all tasks defined within this PWS when the Government facility is not closed for the above reasons.   Normal work hours may be modified by the Government at any time in order to meet critical missions. <br> 1.5.1.2.  Exercise Hours.  Exercise hours are based on exercise objectives and are established for each exercise on a case-by-case basis.  The length of exercises will vary in duration ranging from a single day event to several days or weeks.  Exercises will occur on Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal Holidays.  The contractor shall provide exercise support with 24-hour operations seven days a week.  <br> 1.5.2.  Security Requirements. <br> 1.5.2.1. General. The Contractor shall comply with security plans as well as applicable Army security regulations.  All Contractor employees shall be able to obtain and maintain eligibility for access to <br> classified information at the Secret level prior to contract start date to include Phase-In period.
