The HQAMC Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or another external forum.  The proper address for AMC level protests is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer (KO) at Mission and Installation contracting Office, Joint Base Lewis-McChord is the only person authorized to approve changes or modify any of the requirements under this contract, and notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the KO.  In the event the Contractor or contract employee effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the KO, the change will be considered to have been without authority, and no adjustment will be made in the contract price under the Changes clause or any other clause to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.<br />

<br />
Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes will be evaluated based on price and delivery.  Price is the most important factor. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>Procedures for commercial vehicle access to military installations are varied.   To enter the installation, the Contractor should thoroughly comply with the access procedures of a respective installation. The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the access procedures enforced by each military installation.  The Contractor shall completely coordinate with the military installations and the delivery point of contacts. <BR> <BR>Procedures for commercial vehicle access to JBLM are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling (253) 967-1733.  As of 15 January 2002, the following requirements apply.  Commercial vehicle access to JBLM-Main will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) on Monday through Friday.  This gate will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2000 hours.  The Logistics Center Gate is closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays).  On Saturdays and Sundays, commercial vehicles must use the DuPont Gate (Exit 119 from I-5).  DuPont Gate hours are 0530 hours until 2000 hours.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.

(1) If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.     (2) Large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5" clearance) will require a time stamped "searched" label to gain access to JBLM-North.  "Searched" labels will be issued at the Logistics Center Gate or the DuPont Gate, as appropriate.

(a)  Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program  commercial vehicle access to JBLM will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on JBLM-North. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.

On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5" clearance) will require a time stamped "searched" label to gain access to Joint Base Lewis-North.  "Searched" labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to JBLM-North must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5" in height and that they will require access to Joint Base Lewis-North.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a "searched" label.

The contractor shall accept payment by the Government commercial purchase card.  All costs associated with the use of a Government credit card, e.g., transaction fees, must be included in the price for the appropriate CLIN(s).<br />
(b)  The Government may use the purchase card to pay for the fixed items and for oral or written delivery orders.  "Oral delivery order" means an order placed orally either in person or by telephone, which is paid for by Government Commercial Purchase Card.  <br />
(c)  The contractor, to whom this contract is awarded, shall not process a transaction for payment through the purchase card clearinghouse until the purchased supplies have been shipped or services performed.<br />
