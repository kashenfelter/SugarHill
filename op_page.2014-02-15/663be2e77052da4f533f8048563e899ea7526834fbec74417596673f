		<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Contracting Officer is utilizing policies and procedures prescribed in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. Solicitation Number RFQ 0113-14 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72 effective on January 30, 2014. Mediators and Fair Employment Practice Agencies (FEPA) that can satisfy the requirements listed below are encouraged to submit a quotation. This solicitation is considered an unrestricted procurement.</p><br />
<p>The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Washington, DC 20507 has a requirement for mediators to provide mediation services to resolve disputes through the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process for private sector charges filed with the EEOC at various EEOC District, Field, Local and Area offices. Due to severe budgetary constraints, EEOC anticipates awarding only a limited number of contracts on an as needed basis, primarily in areas where EEOC staff are unavailable to mediate due to geographic and travel limitations. Locations of mediations is unpredictable and will vary within each EEOC office, depending upon availability of EEOC staff in conjunction with instances where parties have agreed to mediate their dispute. Given the limited funds budgeted for this action and the uncertainty in the number and location of cases to be mediated, EEOC will not be able to group or "bunch" cases in a specified location within a specified time period and will strongly consider a mediator's ability to travel throughout a District/Field Office location for a single dispute. Failure to provide mediation service in a timely manner absent reasonable cause after a case has been assigned will lead to termination of the contract.</p><br />
<p>Mediators will not have decision making authority. They will assist the parties in settling their employment discrimination disputes before the EEOC and shall remain impartial to either party. Charges of employment discrimination to be mediated may involve numerous and interrelated issues, complex fact patterns and employers with large or small workforces. Mediation services are contemplated for the following EEOC District and Field Offices or in other Offices that report to the 16 named offices: 1. Atlanta, GA; 2. Birmingham, AL; 3. Charlotte, NC; 4. Chicago, IL; 5. Dallas, TX; 6. Houston, TX; 7. Indianapolis, IN; 8. Los Angeles, CA; 9. Memphis, TN; 10. Miami, FL; 11. New York, NY; 12. Philadelphia, PA: 13. Phoenix, AZ; 14. San Francisco, CA; 15. St. Louis, MO; 16. Washington, DC. The specific address and point of contact for each location are available on the ADR Geographical Locations and Points of Contact List (Attachment A). The EEOC contemplates the award of multiple Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order Contracts. The unit of issue per mediation is $800 each. Travel expenses are included in the unit price of $800.00 per mediation. The Commission guarantees a minimum of one (1) mediation for each contract, and the estimated maximum number of mediations per contract is thirty-one (31) for the base period, a maximum of 31 mediations per option year, and a maximum of 155 if all options are exercised. The Government does not guarantee a maximum quantity. Given the anticipated limited funding for this solicitation, it is extremely unlikely that the maximum quantity will be reached. Task Orders will be issued under each contract on a fixed price basis. Period of Performance: The estimated period of performance for the basic contract is from the effective date of award through twelve (12) months with four (4) one-year (12 months) option periods. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by providing written notice to the contractor prior to the expiration date of the contract.</p><br />
<p>The quotation package shall include the following line items in a written quotation: CLIN 0001. Base Period - Mediation Services: (See Mediator Minimum Qualifications under General Requirements), CLIN 0002.

Option Year 2 - Mediation Services: (See Mediator Minimum Qualifications under General Requirements), CLIN 0004.

FEPA Mediation Participation Qualifications Sheet (Attachment C), and 3. Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment D).

An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov/far. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the System for Award Management (SAM) website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (o) of this provision.</p><br />
<p>The contractor shall perform the following tasks: Mediators shall attempt to assist parties to resolve employment discrimination disputes filed with EEOC. Mediators may be required by some or all of the District Offices listed in Attachment A. A task order will be issued to initiate performance under the Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract. The task order will include the charge name, and a brief narrative/information regarding the charge (charge file or other information). The mediation shall be completed within 45 calendar days of receipt of the charge information. The mediator shall ensure that a date and time are established and arrangements are made for the mediation site convenient for the parties involved in the disputes. The mediator shall contact the COR to determine if Government owned or leased facilities are available for mediation. If Government owned or leased facilities are not available, the mediator must provide facilities at no cost to the parties or EEOC at a site convenient to both parties. All contact information for the mediation will be provided to the COR within five (5) calendar days of receipt of charge information. All mediator travel costs shall be assumed by the mediator. The EEOC will not reimburse the mediator for any travel costs required in performance of this contract. In the event that a party to the mediation requests a postponement or does not wish to participate in the Mediation Program, the mediator shall notify the COR within three (3) business days. The mediator shall destroy the charge file within seven (7) calendar days from the date of the completion of the mediation or seven (7) calendar days from the date that a Party to the Mediation refuses to participate in the Mediation Program. MEDIATOR ORIENTATION: EEOC, when required, will provide post award orientation to the mediator on EEOC policies and procedures, EEO law, standard of conduct for mediators, and preparing settlement agreements. The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) a list of mediators who require the orientation described above within 45 calendar days after award. MEDIATION: The mediation shall be conducted within the time frames agreed to in advance of the mediation. The mediator shall review the charge file/history of the parties and the issues raised prior to the mediation. The mediator shall assist the parties in defining the problem to be resolved, articulating their views, identify areas of agreement, and help to develop solutions to the issues before the mediator. The mediator shall utilize impasse breaking techniques to facilitate a settlement of the parties. The mediator shall make no attempt to coerce either party during the process in order to reach an agreement on any matter. When a full or partial agreement is reached on the issues, the mediator shall assist the parties in developing a written settlement agreement and obtain the necessary signatures on the document. The mediator shall provide two (2) copies of the settlement agreement to the COR within seven (7) calendar days of the settlement. Information concerning the mediation shall be confidential. The mediator shall notify the parties to the mediation that the content of the mediation and resolution of the mediation shall not be disclosed, except as otherwise provided by the confidentiality agreement or required by law. MEDIATION FOLLOW-UP: The mediator shall complete a case status sheet at the conclusion of the mediation. This status sheet shall include the results of the mediation. The completed status sheet shall be provided to the COR within seven (7) calendar days after the mediation has concluded. The status sheet is to be provided whether the mediation results in a settlement or impasse. Parties to the mediation may be requested to evaluate the effectiveness of the mediation process. The mediator shall be required to provide a copy of an EEOC developed evaluation form and an envelope to the parties. The parties will be requested to complete the evaluation at the conclusion of the mediation session, place it in the envelope provided and seal the envelope. The mediator shall be required to forward the sealed envelopes to the COR along with all other required forms. All data collected are the property of EEOC. OPTIONAL TELEPHONIC CONTACTS (No Charge): The COR will provide the contractor with information to contact the parties to determine if they want to participate in the mediation process by discussing the concept of mediation, the mediation process, and the mediation program. If either party declines to participate in mediation, the charge file shall be returned to the COR. The caller who contacted the parties may be eligible to mediate the case when approval is obtained from the COR. The contractor has 30 calendar days after receipt of the charge file to contact the parties, and return the charge file to the COR. FEPA PARTICIPATION: Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs) seeking consideration for a mediation contract must have a current charge resolution contract with EEOC. FEPAs must also demonstrate in their quotation that they meet all of the minimum requirements set forth in Attachment C. Failure to meet any of the minimum requirements will disqualify a FEPA from participation. In general, a prospective FEPA participant must demonstrate that the following general programmatic requirements have been met: 1. FEPA has a current mediation program, and will utilize a facilitative mediation style.; 2. FEPA's mediation service is provided by internal FEPA staff separate from other FEPA enforcement and legal staff.; 3.

<p>Evaluation Factors for Award: The evaluation factors that will be used by the Government during the evaluation process are listed as follows in ascending order of importance: Factor 1 - Technical Capability, and Factor 2 - Past Performance. Factor 1-Technical Capability: Quotations will be evaluated on the vendor's ability to: 1. Meet the requirements regarding the mediator qualifications. Factor 2 - Past Performance: The vendor must provide a minimum of two (2) references for past experience for similar work by fully completing the information requested in Attachment D concerning the quoter's past experience. Evaluation will also include, among other criteria, quoters' success rates, EEO mediation experience, past performance in same or similar mediation programs and appraisal information received from supervisors and program managers. Note to quoters: In the event that problems arose during the performance of your services, quoters should provide a narrative of the circumstances and any corrective actions undertaken to correct the problem, the resulting action taken by the program manager and the overall impact this event(s) placed on performance under the contract.</p><br />
<p>FEPA quoters will be evaluated on additional criteria by fully completing the information requested in Attachment C. Failure to complete fully Attachment C will result in the Quoter's disqualification.</p><br />
<p>Given its current limited budgetary situation, EEOC will strongly consider the extent that quoters can augment the coverage and the geographic scope of EEOC mediation workload, with additional consideration given providing service in areas underserved by EEOC staff mediators. Underserved areas differ from one EEOC office to another. An underserved area is a site where a mediation is to be held but is difficult or prohibitive for EEOC staff to attend. Underserved areas typically begin approximately fifty miles from the EEOC office where the charge was filed. EEOC will also consider the quoters ability to mediate in a foreign language. Quoters must state if there are any mediations relating to any statute(s) or issues which it considers itself to be unqualified or unwilling to conduct. Quoters must specify where they are not able to perform mediations by state and/or county. Again please note that EEOC does not provide reimbursement for travel expenses.</p><br />
<p>Geographical Coverage: A quoters willingness to conduct mediations throughout an office's jurisdiction may be taken into account. Additional points or elevation in ranking may be granted if the quoter is flexible to mediate at any location throughout an office's jurisdiction. While some offices may take this into account, others may not depending upon the individual work needs of that office. Quoters should state their availability to mediate in the following geographic areas (these are listed in no particular order of importance as the needs of the offices vary); 1. Limited Areas-the quoter will mediate in only certain geographical areas and not others. 2. Underserved areas. and 3. All Areas. Purchase Card-Additional consideration will be given to a quoter that accepts a purchase card as a method of payment.</p><br />
<p>Pricing: EEOC will not request a price quote from quoters under this RFQ, because the unit price of $800.00 has been established for each mediation case requirement. The Government will not evaluate price under this RFQ. Therefore, pricing information will not be accepted or considered.</p><br />
<p>EEOC technical evaluator(s) will rank the quoter (firm) considered to be the most highly qualified in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in this RFQ, in order of preference. Award will be made to the highest technically rated quotation(s). The award of multiple Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contracts is contemplated. The Government reserves the right to evaluate quotations and make contract award(s) without discussions with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, quoters must submit their most favorable terms from a technical standpoint. The evaluation of the quotations shall be within the sole judgment and discretion of the EEOC. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Contract award(s) will be based on the evaluation factors listed in this RFQ.</p><br />
<p>Applicable Provisions and Clauses: The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The vendor shall include a completed copy of the provisions at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with your quote.
