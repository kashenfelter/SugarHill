<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p><br />
<p>BACKGROUND</p><br />
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p><br />
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p><br />
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p><br />
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p><br />
<p>INTRODUCTION</p><br />
<p>The Personnel Specialist will provide recruitment and other administrative support for program funded U.S. Personal Services Contract (USPSC) employees in OTI.  The Personnel Specialist is supervised by OTI/Operations and Management Division's (OMD) Senior Personnel Specialist or his/her designee.</p><br />
<p>OMD in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. OMD is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service.</p><br />
<p>Within the OMD, the Pre-Employment, Recruitment, and Contracts  (PERC) Team is responsible for analyzing needs, developing solutions, and advising on issues related to contracts, recruitment, and staff management in direct support of OTI's numerous field programs. The PERC Team regularly participates in core DCHA/OTI process design, development and training exercises.  The goal of the PERC Team is to create and maintain an enhanced response capability to support staff management and effective processes for OTI field and Washington teams. The team accomplishes this through working closely with regional teams in order to track staffing needs and support the overall mission of the office as well as address the needs of individual teams.</p><br />
<p>Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p><br />
<p>This is a key position in an exciting and busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations overseas.  For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support.  The incumbent must be a proficient writer and proofreader, and The Personnel Specialist has the ability to maintain flexibility in a fast-paced dynamic environment while managing competing priorities and meeting aggressive deadlines.   Providing knowledgeable, rapid response using standard operating procedures and making recommendations for improvements or innovations to increase effectiveness and efficiency is critical to successful implementation of OTI's programs and fulfillment of OTI's mandate.</p><br />
<p>OBJECTIVE</p><br />
<p>The purpose of this solicitation is to hire a Personnel Specialist within OTI's Pre-Employment, Recruitment and Contracts (PERC) team.</p><br />
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p><br />
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p><br />
<p>The work of the Personnel Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Personnel Specialist requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Personnel Specialist is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Personnel Specialist is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Personnel Specialist has a strong sense of responsibility, is service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Personnel Specialist is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p><br />

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p><br />
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p><br />
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p><br />
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p><br />
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p><br />
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p><br />
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p><br />
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p><br />
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p><br />
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p><br />
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p><br />
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p><br />
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p><br />
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p><br />
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p><br />
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p><br />
