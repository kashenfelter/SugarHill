		ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO SEPARATE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD. This is a total Small Business Set-Aside.<br />
<p>Architect-Engineer (A-E) services are required for a firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Structural Engineering Services. The work for this contract shall occur at various Navy and Marine Corps facilities and other military installations located in the NAVFAC Southwest Area of Responsibility (AOR): California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The preponderance of work will be in Southern and Central California. The Offeror/Contractor must demonstrate adequate in-house staffing capable to self-perform at least 50 percent of the cost of the contract as required by FAR Clause 52.219-14 (b)(1) Limitation on Subcontracting.</p><br />
<p>A-E Design and Engineering Services shall mainly provide for, but not be limited to, STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING related facilities. Structural engineering services may involve many types of buildings and structures of various sizes and configurations, as well as high bay structures, long span structures, containment vessels (tanks), weight handling equipment, retaining structures, towers, and bridges.</p><br />
<p>Primary Structural Engineering A-E services are required for preparing: Requests for Proposals (RFP) packages for Design-Build projects; fully designed plans and specifications; structural investigations, studies, evaluations, and recommendations for upgrade of existing facilities; antiterrorism design related to analysis of blast effects and design to prevent progressive collapse; innovative structural system design including seismic base isolation, seismic damping, passive dissipating systems and use of fiber reinforced polymers; and other structural engineering services.</p><br />
<p>Secondary A-E services may be required for: preparation of DD Form 1391 or similar planning and programming related documents; technical reviews of Government prepared RFP packages for Design-Build projects and Government prepared design documents; and construction contract support services (CCSS) or post-construction award services (PCAS).</p><br />
<p>Support services may include: topographic surveying; geotechnical engineering; cost estimating; material testing; corrosion testing; and identification and abatement methods of existing asbestos containing materials, lead-based paint, and other hazardous materials.</p><br />
<p>The maximum contract value may not exceed $10,000,000 aggregate total. The minimum guarantee for the contract shall be $5,000. The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial task order. The maximum value of individual task orders executed under this contract is $3,500,000; however, the preponderance of task orders will be less than $500,000. There will be no dollar limit per year. Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates. Contract term is for a one-year base period with four option periods. Each performance period will run 365 (366 for leap year) calendar days. The hourly rates will be negotiated for each performance period. The Government may exercise the option period unilaterally. Per NFAS 17.208-100(c)(1), options for post construction award services may be negotiated on individual task orders for unilateral exercise. The estimated start date is October 2014. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 (Engineering Services) and the annual small business size standard is $14 Million.</p><br />
<p>The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. The contractor is not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. Firms that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract or task order issued under the resulting contract are prohibited from providing the subsequent construction. This limitation also applies to subsidiaries/affiliates of the firm.</p><br />
<p>SELECTION CRITERIA AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: Brooks Act (PL 92-582) and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6 selection procedures apply. The evaluation and selection will be based on the following criteria: Criterion 1, Professional Qualifications; Criterion 2, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence; Criterion 3, Capacity; Criterion 4, Past Performance; Criterion 5, Location and Knowledge of the Locality; Criterion 6, Quality Control; and Criterion 7, Volume of Work. SF330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm based on criterion responses. Criteria 1 and 2 are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria 3, 4, 5, and 6 are slightly less important and listed in descending order of importance; and Criteria 7 is of lesser importance and will be used as tiebreaker among technically equal firms. Evaluating past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. In evaluating an Offeror's capability, the Government shall consider how well the Offeror complied with these instructions. All projects provided in the SF330 (Architect-Engineer Qualifications) must be completed by the office/branch/individual team member actually performing the work under this contract. Projects not performed by the office/branch/individual team member will be excluded from evaluation consideration.</p><br />
<p>Submission Requirements: <br />The SF330 Part 1 is limited to 30, 8.5"x11" single-sided pages. Minimum font size is 10. Submit the following: a) One (1) original and two (2) copies of the SF330 for the prime Offeror (which also includes a completed Part II for the firm and key subcontractors) addressing the following selection criterion information; and b) one compact disk copy, in Adobe Acrobat format, of the complete SF330 being submitted by the firm. The organization chart, A-E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS) and Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) evaluations shall not be counted as part of the 30 page limitation.</p><br />
<p>SF330, Part 1, Section B: Contract Information: In Block 5, list firm's Dun and Bradstreet Number in addition to the name of the firm.</p><br />
<p>SF330, Part 1, Section D: Organization Chart: In addition to the Instructions provided for the SF330, (i.e. the names and roles of all key personnel in this contract/solicitation and the firm they are associated with), identify the overall relationship and lines of authority of the proposed team, including key subcontractors. (Note: All individuals listed on the organization chart are not required to have a resume in Section E, such as administrative or lower level engineering positions, or individuals not providing primary structural engineering services.) This chart shall not be counted as part of the 30 page limitation. This chart must be affixed to the submittal to avoid separation in handling.</p><br />
<p>SF330, Part 1, Section E, Resumes of Key Personnel, CRITERION 1, PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS: Professional qualifications of the proposed team members assigned to this contract in preparation of the required primary and secondary structural engineering services shall be evaluated. The evaluation will place more emphasis on qualifications in primary structural engineering services.

<p>A "specific project" is a single project/function contract or a single task order under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity or On-Call type Contract. "Recent" is defined as professional services completed within the past five years prior to the SF330 due date (February 2009 or later for purposes of this synopsis). Projects must be complete as of the SF330 due date. "Completion" is defined as the date that the study/investigation was completed and submitted, or the date that the final design or design-build package was completed. Projects not meeting these requirements will not be considered.</p><br />
<p>SF330, Part 1, Section F, Example Projects, CRITERION 2, SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: Specialized experience and technical competence of the proposed team members in the preparation of the required primary and secondary structural engineering services shall be evaluated. The evaluation will place more emphasis on experience in primary services. Projects completed by the prime A-E firm identified in Part I may be given more consideration in the evaluation process than projects of proposed subcontractors. Projects completed in California may be considered more favorably in the evaluation process.</p><br />
<p>Submission Requirements:<br />For the proposed team, submit a maximum of ten (10) specific, recently completed projects that best illustrate overall team experience in the required structural engineering services. Provide the month and year of completion of professional services for each project.

<p>Submit a brief description of the project within block 24 of SF330, Section F. Firms with multiple offices shall indicate which office performed the services. In addition, address key elements for each project by describing: 1) Specific Structural Engineering services performed by the firm; and 2) Sustainable features incorporated in the project (if none or if not applicable to the project, affirmatively state so).</p><br />
<p>A "specific project" is a single project/function contract or a single task order under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity or On-Call type Contract. "Recent" is defined as professional services completed within the past five years prior to the SF330 due date (February 2009 or later for purposes of this synopsis). Projects not yet completed will not be evaluated. "Completed" is defined as the date that the study/investigation was completed and submitted, or the date that the final design or design-build package was completed, and does not include construction contract support services or inspection during construction. Projects shall have been performed by the office(s) (main or branch) identified in Part 1, Section C. Projects not meeting these requirements will not be considered.</p><br />
<p>If the proposed team is a joint venture (JV), information should be submitted as a joint<br />venture; however, if there is no information for the JV, information should be<br />submitted for each JV partner, while ensuring you do not exceed the maximum of ten (10) projects for the proposed team. If a project was performed by a JV, and all JV members are not on the team proposed for this contract, the firm should specifically address the work performed by the JV member submitting on this contract. Likewise, if the team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly identify the work actually performed by the team member and their roles and responsibilities on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities teaming on this contract, the project may not be considered for evaluation.</p><br />
<p>SF330, Part 1, Section G, Key Personnel Participation in Example Projects: Submit in accordance with the SF330 Instructions. From the total projects listed in Section F, provide a maximum of ten (10) projects.</p><br />
<p>SF330, Part 1, Section H, Additional Information requested by Agency. Address the remaining Criteria 3 through 7; additional sheets may be used up to the maximum of 30 total pages for Part 1. See submission requirements. Clearly identify the Criterion number and title.</p><br />
<p>CRITERION 3, CAPACITY: Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time shall be evaluated.</p><br />
<p>Submission Requirements:<br />Submit a narrative that demonstrates the firm's capacity to accomplish work in the required time frames. Address key elements by identifying and discussing: 1) Present workload; and 2) Availability of the project team (including subcontractors) for the specified contract performance period; 3) Capacity to accomplish multiple task orders simultaneously; and 4) Ability to sustain the loss of key personnel while accomplishing work within the required time limits, to ensure continuity of services and ability to meet surges in unexpected project demands.</p><br />
<p>CRITERION 4, PAST PERFORMANCE: Past performance with relevant contracts/projects with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules with emphasis on example projects presented in Section F. Firms will be evaluated based on past performance assessments and other available information regarding past performance. Points of contact provided in other criteria may be contacted. A proposal with no record of relevant past performance information shall be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Superior performance ratings on relevant projects may be considered more favorably in the evaluation process.</p><br />
<p>Submission Requirements:<br />Show past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Submit an A-E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS) or a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) evaluation for each project listed under Criterion 2.

Offerors intending to deliver the SF330 in person to the facility at the address above are cautioned that this NAVFAC Southwest facility is located in downtown San Diego.

SF330s are to be delivered to the mailroom in Building 128 and reasonable time shall be allowed for the person in the mailroom to receive and time stamp the SF330. The stamp time is determined from the NAVFAC Southwest facility mailroom time stamp and not any other time keeping equipment that the Offeror may own.
