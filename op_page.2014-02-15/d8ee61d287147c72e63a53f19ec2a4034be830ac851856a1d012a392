For detailed elements, "lump sum" or "allowance" figures will not be accepted.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
PRELIMINARIES 25% DESIGN REVIEW<br /><br />
1.	Preliminary drawings for construction projects are a means of identifying alternative approaches to correcting physical and functional deficiencies. The development of these drawings is an interactive process between VA staff and the Engineering Firm in order to produce a narrative and graphical description of possible program alternatives. As appropriate, the VA will make available prior to contract negotiations a tentative priority list of functional areas which may be included in the project, and a statement task.<br /><br />
2.	Prior to beginning any design work, a preliminary meeting will be conducted between the A/E Firm and VA staff. At this stage, the scope of work will be finalized and agreed to by all VA services involved in this project. At this point the A/E Firm will have surveyed the existing facility to verify all existing conditions and become familiar with all deficiencies that need to be corrected. The A/E will write minutes of the meeting to the Contracting Officer for distribution and approval by the appropriate staff.<br /><br />
3.	The Engineering Firm in collaboration with VA staff, will illustrate in sketch form various possible program alternatives and refine them based on continuing interaction with the VA project team. The A/E Firm will then complete and present alternative solutions which are functionally and architecturally viable for consideration.  The VA will select the final concept and subsequently identify the approved scope to be developed in the second preliminary (100%) review stage.<br /><br />
4.	The VA considers originality and imaginative design an essential part of the A/E Firm's responsibility. The total environmental approach is a necessity to all planning. Site, structures, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, open and screened areas and their relationships to each other should be combined to produce a plan that is functional and aesthetically pleasing.  <br /><br />
5.	Complete conceptual alternatives must be displayed on the preliminary drawings.  The work may include the division of an alternative into distinct parts, each of which has an identified priority.  The preliminary drawings must, therefore, be developed so that irrespective of which parts (in priority order) are selected for further development in the Working Drawing phase, the solution shall provide a well designed facility with respect to functional operation, construction phasing, minimized disruption of existing hospital operation, and compatibility with structure and utilities between (1) existing facilities; (2) those for imminent construction; and, (3) those with low priority for future construction.<br /><br />
6.	A narrative to accompany the drawings shall identify construction phasing which will be necessary to permit continuous operation of critical hospital operations.  In addition, areas of new construction and renovation shall be shown.  A detailed listing of submission requirements for phasing is included in a later paragraph.<br /><br />
7.	Subsequent to each VA review of the Engineering Firm's work, The A/E Firm shall incorporate VA recommendations into the Preliminary Drawings.<br /><br />
8.	Review meetings will be conducted at the end of each design phase.  Submit five (5) copies of all narratives, drawings, calculations and cost estimates to be reviewed by VA staff.  The cost estimates will reflect the level of completeness at each review stage.  In addition, the A/E Firm shall take minutes of the review meeting and submit two copies to the Contracting Officer for distribution to VA staff.<br /><br />
9.	The first review shall include the following:<br /><br />
1.	Drawings shall be completed to the review percentage.<br /><br />
2.	Demolition work required for each area.<br /><br />
3.	Provide a design analysis for the Manhattan VAMC Preliminary Phasing Review.<br /><br />
a. Preliminary Impact Analysis<br /><br />
b. Preliminary Recommendations/Solutions.<br /><br />
c. Review of applicable Codes.<br /><br />
d. 1/4 or 1/2-inch scale drawings (typical).<br /><br />
4.	Provide a list of all applicable VA Master Specification sections to be used for this project.<br /><br />
5.	Provide a preliminary cost estimate based on drawings, specifications, and design analysis. Provide appropriate adjustments for phasing and local or market conditions.<br /><br />
6.	Provide five (5) copies of design analysis, drawings and preliminary cost estimates.<br /><br />
7.	The A/E shall attend a design review meeting at Manhattan VA in New York, NY.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
PREPERATION OF CONTRACT DRAWINGS & SPECIFICATIONS 95% DESIGN REVIEW<br /><br />
1.	The A/E shall incorporate all comments from previous VA reviews.<br /><br />
2.	Drawings shall be complete and checked for errors, ready for use as final contract documents including special requirements (i.e. mechanical, electrical, structural, etc.). <br /><br />
