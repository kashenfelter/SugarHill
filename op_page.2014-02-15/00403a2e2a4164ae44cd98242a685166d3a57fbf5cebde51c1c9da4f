 <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Submission Requirements:  The Offeror shall provide a minimum of four (4) projects or up to a maximum of eight (8) projects that were completed within the past five (5) years and best illustrate specialized experience of the proposed team.  If the project submitted was a Design Bid Build (full design), then the design must be complete.  If the project was Design Build, the Design Build construction contract must be complete.  All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and perform work under this contract.  Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from evaluation.  Block 24 shall include the following for each example project :  Experience as prime or consultant (please identify), contract number or project identification number, contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value and a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above.<br /><br />
    <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Projects not completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project.  Instead, list relevant completed task orders that fit within the definition above.  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers will result in a firm being considered less qualified.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Note:  If the Offeror is a joint venture (JV), information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for each joint venture partner not to exceed a combined total of eight (8) projects.<br /><br />
  If a project was performed by a joint venture, and all joint venture partners are not on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract.  Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project will be eliminated from consideration.<br /><br />
  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Criterion 3 - Past Performance (SF 330 Part 1 Section H).  Offerors will be evaluated based on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, innovation, compliance with schedules, cost control, overall safety record, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.  The evaluation of past performance will be based on information provided for on Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) for Criterion 2 projects (see submission requirements below) and may include other information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including information from the  points of contact provided by the offeror.<br /><br />
  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less qualified.  NOTE:  Past performance information for projects listed under Criterion 2 will be given greater weight.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Submission Requirements:  If a completed CPARS/ACASS evaluation is available for a project under criterion 2, it shall be submitted with the completed SF 330 PACKAGE.  If there is not a completed CPARS/ACASS evaluation, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in this notice is provided for the A-E firm or its team members to submit to the client for each project the A-E firm includes under Criterion 2, Specialized Experience.  The A-E Firm shall not submit a PPQ when a completed CPARS/ACASS is available.<br /><br />
  If a CPARS/ACASS evaluation is not available, the offeror shall ensure that correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.  Completed PPQs should be submitted with the SF 330.  If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, the offeror should complete and submit with the offer the first page of the PPQ), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).   A-E firms should follow-up with clients/references to ensure the timely submittal of questionnaires.  If the client requests, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Stuart Johnston, via email at stuart.johnston@navy.mil, prior to the response date.<br /><br />
  A-E firms shall not incorporate by reference PPQs or CPARS/ACASS previously submitted in response to other A-E services procurements.  However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In addition to CPARS/ACASS and/or PPQs, provide past performance by the Prime and team members on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, innovation, compliance with schedules, cost control, overall safety record, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.  Briefly discuss cost control procedures and adherence to project schedules.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Criterion 4 - Quality Control Program (SF 330 Part 1 Section H):  Offerors will be evaluated based on the ability of the internal quality control program to ensure the technical accuracy of the design and engineering services in the aforementioned areas.<br /><br />
