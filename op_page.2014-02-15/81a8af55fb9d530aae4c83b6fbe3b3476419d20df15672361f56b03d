		BACKGROUND. Multidiscipline Design and/or other Professional Services are being procured in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36, as required for planning and design support exclusively for the Southern Expansion Project at Arlington National Cemetery assigned to the Norfolk District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, North Atlantic Division. The Southern Expansion Development is a highly visible, politically sensitive project with a Congressional following and heightened public interest.

Contract capacity will not be shared with other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Districts unless specifically required in support of this single project. Work may include but will not be limited to any or all of the following: design, drafting, planning, programming, cost estimating, topographic or boundary surveys, on site construction management, shop drawing reviews, preparation of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for Design/Bid/Build Projects, various engineering studies, site investigations, value engineering services, subsurface geotechnical investigation, testing, and reports, design services for new construction and/or renovation, demolition, and alterations of existing facilities, environmental studies, testing and reports, hazardous materials testing, abatement, other design services, and construction phase support services. All work must be performed by or under the direct supervision of licensed professional Architects or Engineers. <br>  <br> A single indefinite delivery contract (IDC) will be negotiated and awarded with a base period followed by four (4) option years.

This is not a request for proposal. <br>  <br> ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: This statement provides examples of certain organizational conflicts of interest which are proscribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 9.5. The purpose of this statement is to prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and to prevent an unfair competitive advantage. The following subsections prescribe a non-exhaustive list of limitations on contracting as the means of avoiding, neutralizing or mitigating organizational conflicts of interest. <br>  <br> a. If, under this announcement, the contractor will provide systems engineering and technical direction for a system, but does not have overall contractual responsibility for its development, integration, assembly, checkout or production, the contractor shall not be awarded a subsequent contract to supply the system or any of its major components, or to act as consultant to a supplier of any system, subsystem, or major component utilized for or in connection with any item or other matter that is (directly or indirectly) the subject of the systems engineering and technical direction. The term of this prohibition shall endure for the entire period of this contract and for two (2) years thereafter. <br>  <br> b. If, under this announcement, the contractor will prepare and furnish complete specifications covering non- developmental items, to be used in a competitive acquisition, the contractor shall not be permitted to furnish these items, either as a prime or subcontractor. The term of this prohibition shall endure for the entire period of this contract performance and for either two (2) years thereafter or the duration of the initial production contract whichever is longer. This rule shall not apply to contractors who furnish specifications or data at Government request or to situations in which contractors act as Government representatives to help Government agencies prepare, refine or coordinate specifications, provided this assistance is supervised and controlled by Government representatives. <br>  <br> c. If, under this announcement, the contractor will prepare or assist in preparing a work statement to be used in competitively acquiring a system or services, the contractor shall not supply the system, its major components, or the service unless the contractor is the sole source, the contractor has participated in the development and design work, or more than one contractor has been involved in preparing the work statement. The term of this prohibition shall endure for two (2) years. <br>  <br> d. If, under this announcement, the contractor will provide technical evaluation of products or advisory and assistance services, the contractor shall not provide such services if the services relate to the contractor's own or a competitor's products or services unless proper safeguards are established to ensure objectivity. <br>  <br> e.  If, under this announcement, any personnel of the prime firm or any subcontractor at any tier previously served with the procuring agency in a capacity that provided access to non-public, competitively useful information relevant to the requirements giving rise to this procurement activity, the prime contractor or subcontractor shall avoid deriving an unfair competitive advantage, or the appearance of an unfair competitive advantage, by precluding the use of such non-public, competitively useful information in the preparation of any document responsive to any request of the procuring agency pursuant to this procurement activity.   <br>
