The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance.</p><br />
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK: The contractor shall provide child and adult psychiatric services at the Blackfeet Service Unit, Browning, Montana; and Heart Butte Clinic, Heart Butte, Montana. This will include, but is not limited to: (1) diagnostic evaluation and treatment recommendations, (2) medication management, (3) case consultation with mental health and medical staff; and (4) coordination of care within the hospital and clinic and with other agencies. Demographically this includes all ages and groups, including pediatric and geriatric patients. MAJOR DUTIES: The contract psychiatrist will work closely with the Behavior Health providers, secretary, pharmacy, and other staff at the facilities to provide accurate, quality and timely patient care. The contract psychiatrist will conduct in-depth interviews and comprehensive examinations of patients that include reviewing past medical history. The psychiatrist will request and/or perform advanced diagnostic tests and examinations deemed necessary to obtain all possible information related to each case. Makes preliminary diagnosis, directs, prescribes or provides relatively new treatment regimens, or arranges for specialized care, or patient referral as required. The contract psychiatrist will base decisions on information obtained, expert professional medical knowledge, and prescribed policies and procedures. Relevant patient-provider interview details or observation notes will be incorporated into clinical records/electronic health record (EHR). The contract psychiatrist must complete required documentation for accurate billing, ordering of diagnostic tests, and medications for every 20 minute patient visit. The medical record must be completed according to hospital policy. The contract psychiatrist will conduct specialty clinics, making observations appropriate to the outpatient's underlying disease and treatment plan, including current symptoms. The contract psychiatrist will review the patient's medications, diet, therapy course, adherence to management plan and patient observations and modify regimen. Instructs and counsels patients and family members as required. The contract psychiatrist will work closely with other medical officers and allied health professionals such as substance abuse counselors, psychologists and other family services staff, et cetera. The contract psychiatrist and Service Unit staff will coordinate overall health care services to meet the patient's medical, psychological and social needs. The contract psychiatrist will refer only those patients requiring specialized inpatient, or other complex treatment, to appropriate contract medical facilities or to other government health care facilities. The contract psychiatrist will have detailed clinical information available for care that cannot be adequately provided at the local IHS facilities. Participates in quality assurance measures, as appropriate, including peer reviews. Plans work, sets priorities, establishes work unit goals and objectives; and plans and establishes work schedules for completion of work. Trains medical students, interns or residents in their specialty or related area of specialization. Assists in the provision of continuing education, on-the-job training, and evaluates medical procedures and processes relative to assurance of quality patient care. As required, performs medically related or patient care assignments that fall outside the designated area of specialization or experience. May serve as patient escort when medically required; usually non-scheduled aircraft or ground transportation. Provides emergency care as required. Required to diagnose and treat non-Indian patients in emergency situations. The contract psychiatrist is subject to Indian Health Service Medical staff by-laws including credentialing and privileging rules and regulations. The contract psychiatrist must comply with all requirements for appointment to, and maintaining status as an active member of, the medical staff. KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED BY THE POSITION: Doctor of Medicine Degree or Doctor of Osteopathy is required. Unrestricted license to practice medicine in a State, District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory of the United States is required. Board certification by an approved American Specialty board or graduate training and experience related to the specialty and subspecialty leading to board eligibility. Ability to work with people from a variety of backgrounds and different cultures. Skill, tact and diplomacy are required while working in stressful situations. Knowledge of medical terminology and coding procedures and ability to input into electronic systems. QUALITY ASSURANCE: The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) or Clinical Director (CD) will provide technical oversight through the Quality Assurance Program of the Medical Staff. The contract psychiatrist is recognized as a technical expert in this medical specialty so the work accomplished is considered technically authoritative and almost always, accepted without review. Work will be reviewed for conformance to IHS policies, practices, and procedures; and current professionally accepted medical practices relating to direct patient care. Work that involves extremely complex diagnostic decisions or highly unusual treatment must be discussed with the CMO or CD, who oversee the condition of the patient and all aspects of treatment regimen. The work is evaluated through the Quality Assurance Program, Governing Body and Medical Staff of the Service Unit. Monitoring of contract compliance and appropriate record keeping will be conducted using time and attendance logs, meeting minutes, and peer review chart audits. GUIDELINES: Works within the framework of approved medical and psychiatric practices making judgments in the treatment of patients. In nearly all cases, the contract psychiatrist's expert judgment is the key factor in determining whether guidelines are adhered to, deviated from, or whether new guidelines need to be developed to protect the interests of the patient. Other guidelines available include Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Indian Health Service, Billings Area, Service Unit, and Medical Staff regulations, policies, procedures, and by-laws. In addition, traditional and currently accepted medical practices are available in the form of specialty consultation through other expert physicians, medical journals, and textbooks. COMPLEXITY: The work consists of the broad general practice of medicine, involving diagnoses and treatment of inpatients and outpatients with an extremely wide variety of physical and emotional problems and includes the broad functions of medicine: education, prevention, cure, and rehabilitation, in addition to the practice within the specialty. Assignments are characterized by breadth and intensity of effort and generally involve the simultaneous application of multiple distinct skills, knowledge, and abilities in the care of one or more patients. The work is often difficult and further complicate by the fear and skepticism of patients, redefined or ill-defined problems presented in advanced stages, conflicting data. The contract psychiatrist serves as a consultant on the most difficult cases in the specialty, and performs the most advanced diagnostic and treatment procedures without professional direction. Recognizes rare difficult-to-identify symptoms or signs, and develops a full treatment regimen involving knowledge of new techniques, state of the art methodologies, or the use of prolonged or complicated procedures or advanced, delicate skills. Cases are often critical and require immediate decisions or are complicated because patients fail to respond to previously-tried treatment regimens. SCOPE AND EFFECT: These services directly affect the health and well-being of individual Indian patients, families, and the families of patients, and impacts the health and well-being of the reservation wide community. The contract psychiatrist is recognized as an expert and is consulted by other medical officers, physicians, nurse practitioners and other health professionals within the Billings Area for expert advice and authoritative recommendations. PERSONAL CONTACTS: Personal contacts are with patients, families of patients, other employees, and other medical officers/health professionals within the Billings Area, representatives of other federal, state and tribal health organizations, and administrators and physicians from the private sector. PURPOSE OF CONTACTS: The purpose of the contacts are to exchange information, resolve problems, educate, influence, and motivate individuals and groups to understand and accept recommended medical information, diagnosis, treatment, and therapies. PHYSICAL DEMANDS: The work requires some physical exertion and stamina, extensive walking, standing, bending, and similar activities. Patients will be lifted from time to time; however, assistance in doing so is available. WORK ENVIRONMENT: The work is performed in a hospital or clinical setting, with continual exposure to patients having a variety of illnesses and communicable diseases. The contract psychiatrist may be subject to adverse weather and hostile patients and/or their families. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The IHS shall provide all necessary equipment and supplies. The Blackfeet Service Unit will be responsible for getting the Contractor access and clearance to all computer services necessary to carry out his/her duties. COMPUTER SECURITY: Pursuant to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), the contractor will be required to complete a course in Computer Security Awareness Training (CSAT). This training must be completed annually by all employees including contractors, volunteers, students, and summer externs. The Contractor will be required to comply with the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, "Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors," and the associated Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implementation guidance for personal identity verification for all affected contractor and subcontractor personnel. Access/clearance to all pertinent computer systems, including completing the Rules of Behavior form, Security training; and a Business Partner Interconnection Security Agreement (BPISA), should be coordinated with the Site Manager or LeAnn Christianson, contract Information System Security Officer (ISSO) in the Office of Information Management (OIM) at the Billings Area Office. LeAnn can be reached at (406) 247-7166 or by e-mail at LeAnn.Christianson@ihs.gov. CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (COR): The COR shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractor's technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract. INVOICE SUBMISSION AND PAYMENT: The contractor shall submit its invoice to the Billings Area Financial Management Branch, P.O. Box 36600, Billings, Montana 59107, with a courtesy copy to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The Contractor agrees to include the following information on each invoice: (1) Contractor's name, address and telephone number; (2) Contract Number; (3) Invoice number and date; (4) Cost or price; (5) Dates of Service including the number of days worked; and (6) Remit to address. Payment shall be made by the Billings Area Financial Management Branch, P.O. Box 36600, Billings, Montana 59107. PRO-CHILDREN ACT OF 1994: The Contractor certifies that it will comply with the provisions of Public Law 103-227, Pro-Children Act of 1994, which imposes restrictions on smoking where federally funded children's services are provided. CHILD CARE NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK AND INVESTIGATION (CNACI). A CNACI must be completed for all Indian Health Service (IHS) contractor personnel within the Billings Area. Public Law (P.L.) 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act and P.L. 101-647, Crime Control Act of 1990, require the IHS to conduct a character and criminal history background investigation on all contractors performing services in IHS facilities. The Service Unit will conduct the character and background investigations. Fingerprints must also be taken as part of the pre-employment process and must be completed before the contract psychiatrist is allowed to work. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. All IHS regulations and policies applicable to these Acts shall be enforced. The Contractor shall comply with IHS facility infection control and safety procedures, practices, and standards.<br /><br />PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition.

The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The following FAR and Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) clauses are applicable: 52.204-4, 52.204-7, 52.204-9, 52.204-13, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.215-5, 52.217-8, 52.217-9, 52.223-5, 52.223-6, 52.224-1, 52.224-2, 52.225-25, 52.227-14, 52.227-17, 52.228-5, 52.229-3, 52.232-11, 52.232-18, 52.232-39, 52.233-2, 52.237-2, 52.237-3, 52.237-7, 52.242-15, 52.242-17, 352.201-70, 352.202-1, 352.203-70, 352.215-1, 352.215-70, 352.222-70, 352.223-70, 352.224-70, 352.227-70, 352.231-71, 352.237-70, 352.237-71, 352.237-72, 352.239-73, 352.242-71, 352.242-72, 352.242-73, and 352.270-2.
