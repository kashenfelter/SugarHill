Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>STATEMENT OF NEED: Propane for Fritz Peak Observatory</p><br />
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Chemical Sciences Division (CSD) of NOAA/OAR/ESRL maintains for atmospheric observations a remote facility called the Fritz Peak Observatory, located near Rollinsville, CO. Scientific work is conducted on a sporadic basis, so the facility needs to be available on short notice. As such, constant maintenance, upkeep, and utilities are needed year-round. The facility is heated by, and produces hot water by, a propane-fired boiler system. Since the facility is located at an elevation of ~9000 feet above sea level a constant supply of propane is required to ensure against water pipes bursting.</p><br />
<p>OBJECTIVE<br />The objective of CSD is to ensure an uninterrupted and adequate supply of propane to the facility.</p><br />
<p>SCOPE<br />The Contractor is responsible for supplying propane to the Fritz Peak Observatory, 19126 State Highway 119, Blackhawk, CO 80422 (located near Rollinsville, CO). The total amount of propane to be delivered for this requirement is between 100 and 500 gallons per month (varies seasonally; ~5,000 gallons annually). Regular deliveries will be supplemented by occasional emergency deliveries, as needed.</p><br />
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The base period of performance for this requirement is 12 months, beginning March 1, 2014 and ending February 28, 2015, with the option to extend up to four additional years.</p><br />
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />All deliveries are to be made to the Fritz Peak Observatory, 19126 State Highway 119, Blackhawk, CO 80422 (located near Rollinsville, CO). The point of delivery is the propane storage tank located to the rear of the main building.</p><br />
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS<br />The propane delivered shall be of a quality commensurate with residential and commercial heating purposes, similar to specifications in the attachment. The Contractor shall check the fill status of the propane storage tank periodically (approximately twice per month) to ensure an adequate supply of propane is always on hand.</p><br />
<p>All propane will be delivered to the storage tank located to the rear of the main building. The tank will be filled in accordance with standard industry safety practices. The site is generally not manned, so deliveries can be made without a facility representative present. Delivery notices should be mailed to the administrative assistant point of contact shown below.</p><br />
<p>If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and the agency technical contact shown below shall coordinate the initial delivery to ensure the Contractor understands the location of the delivery point. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of the propane tank running dry, causing damage to the facility.</p><br />
<p>SAFETY AND SECURITY<br />All rules concerning safety, not smoking, and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p><br />
<p>POINTS OF CONTACT<br />To be provided at time of award.</p><br />
<p>INVOICING<br />The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's propane deliveries and related surcharges and fees. The invoice must include the following items:<br />1. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order;<br />2. Invoice date and invoice number;<br />3. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order;<br />4. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery;<br />5. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt;<br />6. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements).</p><br />
<p>The invoices will be sent to the following address:<br />Administrative Officer<br />NOAA/ESRL/CSD1<br />325 Broadway<br />Boulder, CO 80305<br />&emsp;</p><br />
<p>ATTACHMENT</p><br />
