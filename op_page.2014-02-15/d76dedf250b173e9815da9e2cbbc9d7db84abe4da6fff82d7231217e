		This is a combined synopsis/solicitation, HSCG40-14-Q- P30577, for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format outlined in FAR Subpart 12.6, FAC 2005-72 (Jan 2014), and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 336611 and the Small Business Size Standard is 1000. This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-aside procurement; all responsible sources may submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. The contract will be awarded on a firm-fixed-price basis using simplified acquisition procedures. The requirement is for the dry-docking and repair of USCG STATION KEY WEST (45603).<br />
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p><br />
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p><br />
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p><br />
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p><br />
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p><br />

Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p><br />

This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p><br />
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p><br />
<p><br />(9) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR</p><br />
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each contract line item/CLIN as work progresses.

The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend progress payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subsequent agreement.</p><br />

<p>(14) FAR 52.215-20 ALT IV REQUIREMENTS FOR COST OR PRICING DATA OR<br />INFORMATION OTHER THAN COST OR PRICING DATA (OCT 2010) <br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required<br />(b) If the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness either in the initial solicitation or in any change to the contract after award, the contracting officer will require submission information in sufficient detail in order to make such determination. The information may be as follows:</p><br />
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMAL COST BREAKDOWN<br />In addition to placing your offer in the appropriate place in Schedule of Supplies and Prices, it is requested that you provide a breakdown of your costs, to include but not be limited to, those items identified in the sample format below:<br />Trade, (i.e. laborers, rigger, etc.)<br />Breakdown of labor grades by trade category<br />Man hours per trade, per labor grade<br />Cost/hour/trade<br />Supplies/materials (description &amp; cost of each)<br />Sub-total<br />Pension Plans<br />Overhead at a rate of ______%<br />Profit at a rate of ________%<br />(15) FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />(16) QUOTATIONS SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:<br />(a) The offeror shall identify at least two (2) relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years. For each contract, list:</p><br />
<p>a. Contract number and customer point of contact (including two (2) points of contact <br />With telephone numbers)<br />b. Dollar value of the contract (Original and Final)<br />c. Type of service performed and whether Prime or subcontractor<br />d. Required completion date for the contract<br />e. Date the services were actually completed<br />f. Ship Name, Hull Number<br />g. Contract type (FFP, IDIQ, Requirement, and Cost Type)<br />h. Percentage of growth in contract price (Additional work divided by award price)</p><br />
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p><br />
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE:</p><br />
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br />- Quality of Product or Service<br />Did the customer get what was specified?<br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?<br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?<br />- Timeliness of Performance<br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />How was the customer service? Was the contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Subcontracts<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p><br />
<p>In evaluating contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a contractor's performance will also be considered.</p><br />
<p><br />PRICE:</p><br />
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. The contracting officer will also calculate the foreseeable cost of transporting the USCG STATION KEY WEST (45603) to offeror's commercial shipyard.</p><br />
<p>****Past Performance is significantly more important than Price****</p><br />
<p>(17) FAR 52.215-6 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE (OCT 1997)</p><br />
<p>(a) The offeror or respondent, in the performance of any contract resulting from this solicitation, [ ] intends, [ ] does not intend (check applicable block) to use one or more plants or facilities located at a different address from the address of the offeror or respondent as indicated in this request for quote.<br />(b) If the offeror or respondent checks "intends" in paragraph (a) of this provision, it shall insert in the following spaces the required information:</p><br />
<p>Place of Performance Name and Address of Owner and <br />(Street Address, City, County, Operator of the Plant or Facility if Other <br />State, Zip Code) than Offer or Respondent<br /><br />(18) DISTANCE FACTOR ADJUSTMENT <br /><br />(a) The work will be accomplished at the Contractor's Facility. If the contractor is to perform the work at the contractor's facility, the following distance adjustment factors will be applied to the prices quoted for this work. If the work is performed at the vessel's home pier, the following distance adjustment factors are not applicable.</p><br />
<p>(b) The home pier of the vessel is listed on Page 2. If the work covered by this solicitation is performed elsewhere than the home pier of the vessel, the Coast Guard will incur certain costs incident to moving the vessel to and from such location. Furthermore, Coast Guard inspection and other support in connection with the work covered by this solicitation will be provided by SFLC Naval Engineering Support Unit (NESU) listed in the following paragraphs, which is responsible for support of the vessel. If work is performed elsewhere than at these NESU locations, the Coast Guard will incur certain costs incident to providing inspection and other support. <br /><br />Note: The following foreseeable cost factors will be evaluated and used as part of the award determination.</p><br />
<p>FORESEEABLE COST FACTORS PERTAINING TO DIFFERENT SHIPYARD LOCATIONS</p><br />
<p>(1) There will be a transportation cost for (1) U.S. Coast Guard Representative(s) for (4) round trip(s) between the Contractor's offered place of performance and NESU MIAMI BEACH at the cost of coach-type airfare to be taken from the official airline guide or at a cost of $0.56 per mile if no airline service is available.</p><br />
<p>(2) If the contractor's offered place of performance is more than fifty (50) driving miles from NESU MIAMI BEACH, the "Per Diem" expenses for (16) days to support (1) U.S. Coast Guard Representative(s) while in the city of the place of contract performance will be determined in accordance with the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR).</p><br />
<p>(3) Facility costs to navigate vessel between its home station and the Contractor's offered place of performance (round trip) is $184 per hour.<br /><br /><br />END OF SOLICITATION</p>
