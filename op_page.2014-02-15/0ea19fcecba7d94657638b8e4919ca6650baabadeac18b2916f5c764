DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK<br /><br />
Health Care For Homeless Veterans in Northern Arizona<br /><br />
 <br /><br />
The U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking a Contractor to assist with the provision of emergency residential placement and treatment services through the Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  This contract is designed to serve homeless Veterans (male or female) in need of immediate placement in a safe environment with onsite treatment services.  Many of these veterans have co-morbid conditions that include serious mental illnesses, substance abuse disorders, and other serious medical conditions.  VA intends to engage a Contractor to provide rapid placement of VA-referred Veterans in a safe, residential treatment setting while addressing Veterans' complex needs through on-site clinical treatment and case management services.  The goal of the HCHV Contract Residential Care Program is to rapidly stabilize Veterans' medical, mental health, substance abuse and other psychosocial problems in order to place Veterans in other appropriate transitional or permanent housing within 60 to 90 days, but no more than 180 days.<br /><br />

The VA has particular concern for chronically homeless veterans, many of whom are either undernourished or have developed poor eating habits or both, because of chronic medical, mental health or substance abuse disorders.  A VA dietitian may assess printed menus as well as Veterans' satisfaction with meals and the actual consumption of food offered in determining the contractor's success in meeting this requirement during annual facility inspection or at any point during the contract period.<br /><br />

2.3.	Key Personnel<br /><br />
2.3.1.	The Contractor shall utilize the personnel named in its proposal to perform the services required under this contract.

<br /><br />
2.4.	Admissions and Discharges<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.4.1.	Veterans will be screened and an order will be issued to the contractor by the Contracting Officer.  Excepting lack of available beds, the contractor will be expected to provide admission to the residential care facility and associated treatment services to these Veterans within 24 hours of orders.  The date of admission must be approved by the COR or COR Designees for billing purposes.  Engagement of homeless Veterans in the provision of case management, housing placement planning, and psychosocial treatment services is a key element of the HCHV Contract Residential Care program.  Therefore management of program dropout will be an element of the quality assurance review of this program.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.4.2.	Veterans in the HCHV program will ideally be placed in other transitional or permanent housing suitable for the Veteran within 60 to 90 days from the date of admission, but not more than 180 days from the date of admission.  Contractors may not bill a fixed daily charge for Veterans whose length of stay exceeds 180 days from the date of admission without prior approval from the COR.  The COR will not approve fixed daily charges for lengths of stay exceeding 180 days from the date of admission unless:<br /><br />
i.	There are extenuating clinical circumstances beyond the contractor's control that are barriers to the Veteran's placement in housing; and/or<br /><br />
ii.	There is documented evidence that the contractor has exhausted every effort to place the Veteran in housing sooner; and<br /><br />
iii.	The COR has been appropriately advised of these efforts well in advance of the 180 day limit; and <br /><br />
iv.	The COR concurs that the Veteran will continue to derive therapeutic benefits from a continued stay at the HCHV Contracted Residential Care facility.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.4.3.	In the event that a Veteran's length of stay exceeds 180 days from the date of admission and there is not approval from the COR for continued treatment, the contractor will retain the responsibility for finding suitable transitional or permanent housing in the community at its own expense and the veteran will be discharge from the VA program.  This will be considered a Negative discharge.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.4.4.	Veterans may be discharged from HCHV Contract Residential Care programs for positive, negative or administrative reasons.  The date of discharge must be approved by the COR or COR Designees for billing purposes.  The contractor shall provide discharge planning and referrals for each Veteran, regardless of character of discharge from the facility, to appropriate community resources and services based upon a team assessment of health, social and vocational needs and the involvement of Veterans' families as appropriate.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Discharges will be characterized as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Positive Discharge - a.) the Veteran has been successfully placed as anticipated in transitional or permanent housing, or reunited with family, and has met the goals of his/her Individual Service Plan within 180 days or less; b.) the Veteran has been successfully placed as anticipated in transitional or permanent housing, or reunited with family, and has met the goals of his/her Individual Service Plan in greater than 180 days from the date of admission and the COR has approved continuation of fixed daily charge for payment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Administrative Discharge - the Veteran has been transferred to an alternate level of care with concurrence from the COR through the COR Designees for medical, mental health, or substance abuse treatment to better meet the Veteran's clinical needs.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Negative Discharge - a.) the Veteran has absconded from the facility and his/her whereabouts are unknown; b.) the Veteran has had an episode of violence or has threatened violence against staff or other residents and must be discharged to maintain the safety of the facility; c.) the Veteran has had  more than one episode of drug use at the facility, has failed to engage in or accept treatment alternatives, and must be discharged to maintain a safe and sober environment at the facility; d.) the Veteran's length of stay has exceeded 180 days from the date of admission and the COR has not approved continuation of treatment.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unacceptable Discharge - a.) the Veteran is discharged to a homeless shelter or drop in setting after a length of stay greater than seven (7) days from the date of admission unless there is concurrence from the COR or COR Designees that there is no other alternative due to circumstances beyond the contractor's control; b.) the Veteran is discharged to the streets at any point in time after the date of admission under any circumstances.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.4.5.	Performance Goals regarding discharges will be as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Type of Discharge	Performance Goals	Review Period<br /><br />
Positive discharges	85% or greater of all Veterans admitted to the program	Every six (6) months from the date of the contract award.<br /><br />
Administrative discharges	No more than 10% of all Veterans admitted to the program	Every six (6) months from the date of the contract award.<br /><br />
Negative discharges	No more than 5% of all Veterans admitted to the program	Every six (6) months from the date of the contract award.<br /><br />
Unacceptable discharges	Zero (0) occurrences	Every six (6) months from the date of the contract award.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.5.	Fixed Daily Charge, Billing and Payments<br /><br />
"Fixed daily charge" means that the VA will pay for the eligible Veteran's stay in a residential treatment bed and associated treatment services for each day the Veteran resides at the facility and receives services.  The VA also refers to this as "bed days of care."  Unless specifically excluded in this contract, the fixed daily charge established will include the services listed in this document and will also include the services or supplies normally provided other patients by the facility without extra charge.  It is the contractor's responsibility to have appropriate systems of verification of services in place to justify invoices and payments.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The VA can only pay fixed daily charge for eligible Veterans (i.e., Veterans whom VA places an order to the contractor, or for whom VA authorizes the provision of services) as determined by the local VA medical center HCHV or SFV program.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
VA pays fixed daily charge for each eligible Veteran's exclusive use of a residential treatment bed within a facility.  Therefore, the contractor may not bill the VA and the VA will not pay fixed daily charge for beds that are used by more than one person at a time, such as in shifts.  For example, it is not permissible to bill the VA for a bed that was used by an eligible Veteran at night but then given to someone else to sleep in during the day while the eligible Veteran was attending appointments outside of the facility.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractors may only bill the VA for bed days of care for Veterans who are actively residing at the facility and receiving associated treatment services.  In the case of Veteran absences, the following rules will apply:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.5.1.	Veteran residents will be allowed up to two consecutive days of excused absence from the facility per month.  The contractor will be expected to hold the bed and will be reimbursed for the two days of absence.  An excused absence is defined as an absence that is planned and benefits the Veteran's clinical treatment or community reintegration.  Examples of acceptable excused absences could include a brief hospital stay for a medical evaluation or procedure, or travel to attend a family funeral.  Absences will only be considered excused if the COR or COR Designees is informed in advance of the absence and concurs with the rationale for it.  Documentation must be provided to the Veteran and the COR or COR Designees that indicates permission for the absence, the required date and time of return to the facility, and contractor staff emergency contact information.  Copies of this documentation must be kept on file with the contractor for verification, billing and audit purposes.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.5.2.	Veteran residents who abscond from the facility without prior notice or permission will be considered to have an unexcused absence.  If the Veteran does not return to the facility after 24 hours, he/she will be discharged from the program by the COR or COR Designees.  The contractor will not be expected to hold the bed and will be reimbursed for the discharge date.  The discharge date is the day the 24 hour absence ends; the contractor can bill for the 24 hours that the bed was held in anticipation of the Veteran's return.  For example, if the Veteran signs out on Monday at noon for an appointment but has not returned by Tuesday at noon, the Veteran will be discharged on Tuesday and the contractor can bill for Tuesday.  It is the contractor's responsibility to immediately notify the COR or COR Designees when a Veteran's unexpected absence from the facility exceeds 24 hours.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.5.3.	Payment is to be made monthly in arrears to the address in block 18a of the 1449.  Invoices submitted for payment shall be reviewed for accuracy, verified against time records and attendance logs and shall be subject to approval by the Government prior to remittance of payment.  Any discrepancies found shall be brought to the attention of the Contractor and shall be resolved.  A corrected invoice must then be submitted by the Contractor as instructed by the Government.  Contractors will be provided with specific invoicing instructions at a post-award kick-off meeting to occur within 30 days of the contract award.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.6.	Records and Reports<br /><br />
As part of VA contract oversight, attention will be directed to the adequacy of Veterans' records.  Site visits by VA staff will periodically include a spot check of records to ensure contractor invoices accurately reflect the Veteran's length of stay.  The Contractor will be responsible for the following onsite records and reports:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.6.1.	Daily sign-in sheets signed by program Veterans, to document and verify Veterans' presence at the facility for billing purposes.  Daily sign-in sheets must be completed clearly, accurately and thoroughly with full signatures and monitored so as to provide a full accounting of Veterans' stay and treatment services received for billing and audit purposes.   These sign-in sheets will be hand delivered and/or faxed a minimum of weekly to the COR through the COR designees for review.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.6.2.	The contractor shall maintain an individual clinical record on each Veteran out-placed under this contract.  The contractor must comply with the requirements of the "Confidentiality" of certain medical records (38 USC 7332), and (42 CFR, Part II) when appropriate, and shall be part of the contract.  All case records will be maintained with such security and confidentiality as required, and will be made available on a need-to-know basis to appropriate staff members involved with the treatment program of the veterans concerned.  Individual clinical records will contain the following:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
i.	An initial biopsychosocial assessment.<br /><br />
ii.	Individual Service Plan.<br /><br />
iii.	Relevant Releases of Information to communicate and coordinate Veterans' treatment with VA and other community based service providers.<br /><br />
iv.	Progress notes for each case management encounter to include information regarding progress toward meeting the Individual Service Plan goals.<br /><br />
v.	Documentation of Veteran participation in onsite daily structured activities and groups.<br /><br />
vi.	A final discharge summary.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.6.3.	Contractors will be expected to enter data into a Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) web-based software application and bed totals in the Homeless Inventory Count (see Reference section).  This data will consist of information on the Veterans served and types of treatment services provided by contractors.  Contractors must treat the data for activities funded by the VA HCHV Contract Residential Care program separately from that of activities funded by other programs.  Contractors will be required to export client-level data for activities funded by the VA HCHV Contract Residential Care program to VA on a regular basis.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.6.4.	The Information Technology security requirements for Certification and Accreditation (authorization) requirements do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
