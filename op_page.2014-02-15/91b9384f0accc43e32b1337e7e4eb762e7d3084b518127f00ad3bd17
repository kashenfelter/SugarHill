However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile Number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FEDEX or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 The AMC-level protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp If Internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) All Contractor employees shall be identified as such by wearing badges at all times while performing work at this Government facility and when performing work for the Government under the scope of this contract at other installations or non-government sites to include attendance at meetings, seminars, etc. The badges may be either affixed to clothing or be displayed from a chain or other mechanism worn around the neck. Badges must include contractor?s company name and employee?s name. The badges shall be colored white with black lettering and a minimum badge size of 1.5 inches wide by 3 inches long. A company logo may be placed on the badge, at the company?s discretion.

(d) All Contractor correspondence (written, facsimile, and email display) shall include their company name. <BR> <BR>(a) The Government and the contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the contractor to the Government are non-personal services and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee or master-servant relationships exist or will exist under the contract between the Government and the contractor and/or between the Government and the contractor?s employees. It is therefore in the best interest of the Government to afford the parties a full and complete understanding of their respective obligations. (b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not: (1) be placed in a position where they are appointed or employed by a Federal Officer, or are under the supervision, direction, or evaluation of a Federal Officer, Military or Civilian.

(5) be used in administration or supervision of military procurement activities. (c) Employee Relationship: (1) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the contractor or his employees to exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the Government, but rather the contractor?s employees will act and exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the contractor. (2) Rules, regulations, directions, and requirements which are issued by command authorities under their responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the installation, or who travel on Government transportation. This stipulation is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control which is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract. <BR> <BR>U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground is located in a remote area.
