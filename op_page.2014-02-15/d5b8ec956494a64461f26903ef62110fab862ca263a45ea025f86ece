<p>USCG ALC<br />1664 Weeksville Road<br />SRR Hangar 75, HSCG38-14-Q-200062<br />Attn: Terrie L. Pickard<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909<br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. <br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS HSCG38-14-Q-200062<br /><br /><strong>The following clauses and provisions are included:</strong></p><br />
<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items Jul 2013</p><br />
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation Criteria<br /></span></strong>This purchase order is expected to be awarded on a competitive basis. Quotes will be evaluated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-2 based on the criteria listed below. Award will be made to the offeror representing the best value to the Government.</p><br />
<p><strong>Technical Acceptability:</strong> Technical Acceptability will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a certificate of conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. Part 21 of the Federal Aviation Regulation outlines certification procedures. <br /><br />The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the requirements of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the requirements is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote.</p><br />
<p><strong>Delivery:</strong> The USCG requires delivery of all items as specified in the attached "HSCG38-14-Q-200062 - REQUIREMENTS" spreadsheet. Offerors that can meet the Government's required delivery date will be rated higher than offerors that are unable to deliver on time. Offerors that can deliver sooner than the Government's required delivery date will be rated the highest for this factor.</p><br />
<p><strong>Price:</strong> The contractor shall provide pricing as requested in the attached spreadsheet titled "HSCG38-14-Q-200062 - Requirements". Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section. The offeror's quotation will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 13.106-3, in order to determine if it is fair and reasonable.</p><br />
<p><strong>Past Performance:</strong> The Government may use information available from past contracts/purchase orders with the USCG, delivery information found in the USCG's AMMIS system, and any information found using sources such as Federal Government sources, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)/Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to evaluate past performance. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating.</p><br />

Apr 2011<br />An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via https://www.acquisition.gov .
