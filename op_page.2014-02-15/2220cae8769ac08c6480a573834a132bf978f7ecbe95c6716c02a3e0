		Digital Helmet Mounted Display<br />Request for Information (RFI): #WNUK-14-009<br />
<p>Request for Information: <br />This request for information (RFI) constitutes neither a Request for Proposal or an Invitation for Bid. It does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This RFI should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; this is an RFI only in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a guarantee to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.</p><br />
<p>The Government is also interested in applicable vendor demonstration of technologies and systems (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as defined at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/publications/docs/TRA2011.pdf , pages 2-13 and 2-14). Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information, materials, and/or demonstrations received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by any information received.</p><br />
<p>1. Background and Scope: <br />The United States (US) Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Human Systems Division (HSD), Aircrew Performance Branch exists to protect forces by providing warfighters integrated offensive and defensive capabilities to deter, anticipate, detect, neutralize, assess, and mitigate threats against hazards to air operations.</p><br />
<p>As weapon systems have become increasingly complex and aircrews are exposed to extensive amounts of battlespace information, it has become clear that a significant effort is necessary to provide a revolutionary leap in Digital Helmet Mounted Display (DHMD) capability for the warfighter. Industry and academia have recently made major advances in Helmet Mounted Displays, visual technologies, future force technologies, capabilities, and surrogate material solutions applicable to DHMD capabilities for aircrew personnel.</p><br />
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to determine existing and emerging Developmental, Commercial-off-the Shelf (COTS), or Government-off -the-shelf (GOTS) technology solutions across several areas of interest that can be used to enhance aircrew warfighting operational capabilities with respect to DHMD capabilities. The technologies may address one or more capability areas described below, or potentially address all of the areas as an integrated DHMD system. Each technology addressed must also include a roadmap identifying the timeline for technology development.</p><br />
<p>For the purpose of this RFI, the government is interested in any information associated with DHMD technology (full systems, sub-systems, components, sensors, etc.). Any DHMD related capability that falls within a TRL designation of three through nine, as described in the Technical Areas below is of interest under this RFI.</p><br />
<p>The DHMD system will potentially consist of imaging optics, sensor, processing, and displays all mounted directly on to, or integrated into, an aircrew helmet. Note that this is an extension beyond current HMD systems in aircraft that are restricted to displaying symbology. Systems of interest to this RFI are more consistent with digital implementations of night vision goggles, which will seamlessly integrate imagery captured over multiple spectral bands and symbology information. Of particular interest under this RFI is the marriage of the capabilities of these two systems into one that surpasses the performance of either in terms of functionality while reducing Size, Weight, Ergonomics, Power and Integration (SWEPI). As a point of reference, key technical specifications for fielded night vision goggle systems as well as the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) are provided in Table 1.</p><br />
<p>Table 1: Key Metrics of Currently Fielded Systems<br />Metric ANVIS-9 JHMCS<br />Functional Range Night (&gt; &frac14; moon) Day<br />Field of view (degrees) 40 circular 20 circular<br />Resolution (lp/mm) &ge; 64 ~ 30<br />Frame rate (Hz) ~ 1000 60<br />Display Color Monochromatic Monochromatic<br />Contrast Ratio N/A 1.2:1 (against 10,000' Lambert)<br />Mass (kg) of head/helmet supported components 0.8 ~ 0.4</p><br />
<p>The technology must not pose any safety or health hazards (i.e. toxic components, toxic waste, gases, fumes, burning residue, noise, etc.) against which aircrew personnel cannot be protected.</p><br />
<p>2. Capability Requirements: <br />The Government is interested in receiving information on a broad array of technologies that have the potential to enhance aircrew warfighter operational capabilities in fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft platforms. Respondents must be cognizant of the importance of SWEPI relative to head-borne capabilities, specifically a DHMD orientation. Minimized SWEPI is highly desirable. The Government is interested in receiving white papers focused on the following Technology Areas (TA):</p><br />
<p>TA: Symbology - Symbology depicted in a DHMD capability can greatly enhance aircrew capability. Color symbology is expected to be a DHMD attribute. Placement of symbology is a potential area of enhancement such as location placement in the field of regard relative to the sides, top, bottom, and projected into an environment. Technologies that ease the cognitive burden on the pilot and reduce distractions are highly desirable. This technology could include dynamic adjustment of symbology attributes based on physiological inputs, eye position, situation, etc. as well as conformal symbology, which is the ability to project the information into the environment (i.e., 3D displays).</p><br />
<p>TA: Sensors - Hardware - For helmet mounted imagers, the minimization of SWEPI is paramount. This area encompasses both the focal planes and the paired optics. The most beneficial spectral ranges to be included for in-cockpit (helmet mounted) use are visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared (SWIR). Visible sensors are included to allow for the possible use of an opaque display. The primary goal of the sensors is to allow for as close to human visual system performance in terms of field of view, acuity, and luminance, etc. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to, multi-spectral and/or extended/ enhanced spectral ranges; dynamic binning; and extreme low power focal planes. The imagers will be used to enhance visual ability by providing imagery under low-light level (i.e. night vision) as well as working in coordination with algorithms to enhance objects (e.g., vehicles, people, etc.) of interest. Therefore, performance metrics include not only traditional metrics such as Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), but also metrics such as detectivity and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.</p><br />
<p>It is also anticipated that benefits will be gained from sensor information that is not directly part of the helmet mounted unit. This can include, but is not limited to, mid-wave infrared (MWIR), long-wave infrared (LWIR), as well as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and other non-imaging information. This additional information could come from sensors located directly on the aircraft or from other assets. The challenges for these sensors are similar to those mounted directly on the helmet. Additionally, head-tracking sensors inside the cockpit - mounted on the helmet and/or cockpit interior could prove extremely beneficial to target acquisition and enhanced situational awareness. These sensors also face challenges communicating the information as well as potentially having to adjust the perspective of the imagery to match that of the person wearing the HMD. Addressing these issues might be a combination of hardware and software.</p><br />
<p>TA: Sensors - Algorithms - Algorithms play a critical role in several aspects of a DHMD, which for the purposes of this RFI have been classified into two different categories: 1) image fusion across multiple spectral bands; 2) object detection, recognition, and identification (DRI). Specific tasks of interest under each category include:</p><br />
<p>Table 2: Algorithms of Interest<br />Category Potential/Representative Capabilities<br />Image fusion across multiple spectral bands High frame rate fusion with perspective correction; optimal representations in order to enhance visibility of a) vehicles, b) humans, c) terrain through fog, haze and / or dust; Seeing beyond normal field of regard (through floor, behind vehicle, while under head restraint); ability to see imagery from sensors not helmet mounted including but not limited to changing imagery perspective to match that of user; extracting or creating color information from outside of visible band sensors with particular interest on near and short-wave infrared.<br />object detection, recognition, and identification (DRI) DRI on objects of interest including people and vehicles, which could also include blue and red force designations; cueing tasks which includes, but is not limited to: line of sight, targeting, terrain following / avoidance</p><br />
<p>TA: Data Transfer Protocol - With the ever growing amount of sensor data expected to be displayed at increasingly higher resolutions, aircrews may require faster data transfer protocols that allow for faster display data update and display refresh rates than currently deployed. Solutions must be compatible with current aircraft interfaces (MIL-STD-1553B / Ethernet / USB / WIFI).</p><br />
<p>TA: Displays - The ultimate metric by which displays are judged are by how they are perceived by the user. It will be important to clearly describe how the proposed technology impacts final user specification, which includes field of view, resolution, luminance (display and real-world if see through), latency, dynamic range, color scale, etc. All technologies that can meet the overall requirements are of interest, and include, but are not limited to: high resolution (&gt; 5 megapixel) microdisplays, high-frame rate microdisplays, micro (scale size &#61603; cm2) and macro (scale size ~ 10's cm2) curved/flexible displays and related fabrication methodologies, micro (scale size &#61603; cm2) and macro (scale size ~ 10's cm2) transparent displays and related fabrication methodologies, ultra-low power displays, full color displays, dynamic resolution (i.e., foveating) displays, 3D displays.</p><br />
<p>Note - If the display is to be projected to the eye (i.e. not directly mounted in front of the eyes) then the optical system (e.g., relay optics, free form lenses, waveguides, etc.) responsible for this should be described and the size and weight must be included in the overall system properties.</p><br />
<p>TA: Situational Awareness - Aircrew require the ability to operate in the vicinity of both friendly force units as well enemy forces and must be able to distinguish between the two. Examples of situational awareness may include, but are not limited to, passive and active tagging systems, directional indicators, head referenced video from pod-mounted sources and blue-force/red-force tracking sensor information. Acquiring information and increasing the battlespace and situational awareness through visual enhancement is highly desirable.</p><br />
<p>TA: Human Interface - Optimization of information interface with the user is critical. A large viewing eyebox area ensures unvignetted viewing of the image source. Outside of that area, the image will vignette or be clipped, but will still be visible. Viewing eyebox area should, if applicable, be considered. Exit pupil and eye relief of a pupil-forming optical design should, if applicable, be considered. Image warping to optimize information interface with the user and correction for hyper-stereopsis should be addressed. Image adjustability for inter-pupillary distance across a diverse population of users is desirable.</p><br />
<p>TA: Eye Tracking - In-helmet eye tracking can enhance target acquisition by image registration relative to the eye. Eye tracking can expand target acquisition by allowing information to be presented where the eyes are looking versus where the head is positioned. Expanding target acquisition by tracking the eyes is desirable. Eye tracking can contribute to cognitive and physiological state awareness. Vigilance and sleepiness determined by oculometrics such as Eye Blink Velocity (EBV), Eye Blink Duration (EBD), Percentage of Time Eyes are Closed (PERCLOS), Eye Movement Velocity (EBV), etc. and application of Composite Oculometric Fatigue Index (COFI) are desirable to help identify cognitive and physiological state awareness. SWEPI optimization is applicable to this TA.</p><br />
<p>TA: Head Tracking - Magnetic head tracking, optical head tracking (head-borne light emitting diodes), and reflective head tracking (reflective stickers or paint schemes) are examples of head tracking technologies that are desirable.</p><br />
<p>TA: Aircrew Monitoring - It is highly desirable to be able to measure, interpret, and incorporate aircrew physiological and cognitive information in to the DHMD data flow. Cognitive and Physiological monitoring can facilitate optimization by sensing or detecting cognitive and physiological state, assessing the state relative to performance, and augmenting performance to optimize mission effectiveness such as Auto-de-cluttering of symbology/Adaptive Automation (toggle on/off). Non-invasive monitoring and incorporating physiological and cognitive information will ensure optimum information is presented to the aircrew. It will also enable an objective method to identify degradation in physiological and cognitive performance. This can inform or make recommendations to the aircrew to mitigate potential mishaps related to fatigue, cognitive overload, G-Induced loss of consciousness (GLOC), spatial disorientation, etc. Measuring the physiological and cognitive performance indicators may include, but are not limited to: eye tracking electrooculography (EOG), electrocardiogram (EKG), electroencephalography (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), cerebral oximetry, mask oxygen and carbon dioxide content, volatile organic compound identification and characterization, blood flow, hydration, and other technologies that are non-invasive and capable of being assimilated in an aircrew helmet while taking SWEPI into consideration.</p><br />

<p>1. Company/Institute name<br />2. Address<br />3. Point of Contact<br />4. Cage Code<br />5. DUNS Number<br />6. Phone Number<br />7. E-mail Address<br />8. Web page URL<br />9. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this action is 334511, size standard 750 employees. Based on the NAICS Code, state whether your company qualifies as a:<br />a. Small Business (Yes/No)<br />b. Woman Owned Small Business (Yes/No) c. Small Disadvantaged Business (Yes/No) d. 8(a) Certified (Yes/No)<br />e. HUB Zone Certified (Yes/No)<br />f. Veteran Owned Small Business (Yes/No)<br />g. Service Disabled Small Business (Yes/No)<br />h. Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (Yes/No)<br />i. Statement as to whether your company is domestically or foreign owned (if foreign owned, please indicate country of ownership).<br />j. Provide prospective small business utilization percentages (if the acquisition is not set- aside for small business)</p><br />
<p>Companies may be contacted if we need further information to fully understand the marketplace. AFLCMC is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p><br />
<p>Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist AFLCMC in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages. The acquisition strategy is still being determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. If it is a small business set-aside, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting will apply. Therefore, small businesses that want to be considered for a small business set-aside should demonstrate how they could comply.</p><br />
<p>If there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate, and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. If this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Large and small businesses should provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value as well as supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p><br />
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps (FBO) site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.</p><br />
<p>Respondents should indicate which portions of their responses are proprietary and should make them accordingly. All information received in response to this RFI that is properly marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Proprietary information must be clearly marked on the outside container and on the materials inside. The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages, for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p><br />
<p>Interested parties shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research and demonstrating their technologies. Vendors that submit white papers that demonstrate viable capabilities to enable or enhance aircrew DHMD may be invited to participate in one or more events to demonstrate their technologies. Specific information regarding technology demonstration events will be based on the number of white papers received and technologies selected for demonstration. The Government reserves the right to not conduct technology demonstrations.</p><br />
<p>All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email. Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. All questions and answers regarding this RFI will be posted as updates to this notice. The Government reserves the right to not address questions received after 10 March 2014.</p><br />
