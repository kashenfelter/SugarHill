Detailed problem statement: 

Government procurement is complex

• Each Government entity has its own procurement process, different rules, and unique taxonomy. For example, State of Washington alone has 18 state agencies (not including sub-categories), 39 counties, and 207 cities

• Government RFPs (Request for Proposals) are typically long, archaic and exhaustive. Written to avoid any ambiguity or appearance of favoritism, they are hard to parse through for relevant details

• Getting details right is critical: bid responses are required in a very particular fashion, and anything from wrong font size to wrong type of paper can be grounds for contest of an RFP award, or for disqualification

Small businesses lack resources to mine and evaluate opportunities

• Typically do not have dedicated sales people to parse through various websites, read long RFPs, and understand the right opportunity to bid for

• Spending precious employee time chasing the wrong opportunity is costly, and can threaten survival

• Small businesses cannot afford expensive tools to pare down the noise, to focus on 'real-fit' opportunities
